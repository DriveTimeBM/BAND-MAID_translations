O-mei-syu-sama, hello. I’m Akane.

Today, I introduce Kobato.

Kobato is a man among men, exactly like the Kyushu man. [Note: Japanese people have a stereotype for Kyushu men to be manly, like Texas men in the US. Miku is from Kumamoto in Kyushu.]

And her words and her actions are all so handsome!

She could appear as a man in shojo manga [note: romantic manga for girls].

In addition, she takes her selfies with my iPhone whenever possible.

When I open my data folder, I’m surprised to find it’s full of her faces.

She is a mischievous and handsome pigeon.

Please support Kobato, po!

That’s all from Akane.
