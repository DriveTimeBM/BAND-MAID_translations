Hello. I’m Misa.

Well, this time I introduce Kanami, the guitarist.

So, the first time I saw Kanami, I thought, what a fantastic smile she had.

What to say… This comparison might be weird, but her smile would look good with a sunflower.

Hehe, actually I feel relaxed every time she smiles.

She is very diligent and responsible.

Kanami, you are really cute.

So, see you. That’s all from Misa.
