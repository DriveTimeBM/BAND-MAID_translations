How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

My “Song of the Month” is Youth.

This song, um, has a twin vocal feel by Sai-chan and Koba-san, and I hoped you would have a great time with it at a serving, so I was glad to play it at “The Day of Maid” the other day!

I would be happy if you could watch the video again. [Note: during the archive period.]
