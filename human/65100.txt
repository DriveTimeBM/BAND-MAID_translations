Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

I’ve chosen Anemone for my “Song of the Month”, po.

It’s the ending song of our regular radio show BAND-MAID NIPPON, po.

During the recordings, I always think “This is a nice song that matches perfectly with the ending!”, po.

Everyone, please look forward to the broadcast, po!

As for this image, when my beloved cat Tora-chan was at home alone, I checked a remote camera like “What is he doing?” and found him looking at me with his glowing eyes, and I was scared, po.

Well then, bye-bye, po!
