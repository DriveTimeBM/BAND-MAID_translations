Hello. It’s been a while. I’m Misa. How have you been?

Because of this situation, well, I spend time by increasing practicing time at home.

I try to change my playing form and check it, um, and I practice phrases I’m not good at yet, and so on.

Um, I don’t drink from daytime, and I live quite a healthy life.

Everyone, take care of yourself, and let’s get through it together.

Bye. That’s all from Misa.
