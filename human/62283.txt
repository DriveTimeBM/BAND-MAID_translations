Hello, I’m Misa.

Everyone, how are you?

I’m fine.

My “Song of the Month” is the refreshing tune PAGE.

I thought fall came, but it’s still a little hot, so it will be nice to enjoy the end of summer.

This song is refreshing and nice no matter when you listen to, in the middle of summer or winter, but somehow I thought it’s nice to listen to it now.

Well, the photo is curry with canned mackerel, eggplants, and tomatoes I made the other day.

See you.
