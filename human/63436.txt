I’m Akane.

My “Song of the Month” is Sense!

October 7 is the air date of the TV anime Platinum End! And October 27 is the release date of Sense!

That’s why I chose it for October.

Have you seen Platinum End?

I was so moved by the opening sequence that I got goosebumps!

You must be looking forward so much to the broadcast every week.

Please look forward to the full version of Sense too!

That’s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
