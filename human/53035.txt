05:17 Kanami: in a corridor, or in a dark place a little like an abandoned building.

05:24 Kanami: We hadn’t filmed in a corridor or the like at all before,

05:30 Kanami: well, it was like a school corridor, and it was our first experience,

05:37 Kanami: and we stood quite close to each other, so we filmed it keeping in mind not to bump into each other but still to be intense!
