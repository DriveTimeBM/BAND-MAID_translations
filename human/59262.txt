Hello, everyone. I’m Misa.

As for my “Song of the Month”, I think the rainy season is going to end soon, the temperature is getting really hot, and cicadas have begun to sing, so I’d choose the summery song Youth.

By the way, the image is takoyaki I was eating a little while ago.

Everyone, do you love takoyaki? I LOVE IT!

We all want to go to summer festivals, right? I want to drink beer.

See you.
