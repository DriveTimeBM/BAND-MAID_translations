Hi, I’m Akane. This is my second Q&A.

This is a question from Gaku-san.

“How do you recover when you are depressed?” Actually there were quite a lot of questions of the same content.

When it’s hard, I try not to spend time alone.

I meet bandmates or friends and enjoy myself to the fullest and laugh, and I’ll feel fine again naturally.

Also, I read letters from o-mei-syu-sama and warm comments on SNS, and I’m cheered up quite a lot by them.

Thank you all the time. Please continue to support me!
