O-mei-syu-sama, hello. I’m Akane.

Today I introduce Misa.

Misa is my best partner of the rhythm section.

She has the same sense of humor as me, so we do really silly things all the time and laugh out loud together.

She looks cool at first glance, but she’s not cool at all actually (laughs).

She’s the girliest among us members.

When I go to her house, she always makes a lot of delicious dishes for me.

That’s all from Akane, who is planning to settle in her house soon for that.

Well then, bye-bye.
