I’m Kanami, the guitarist. Today I’d like to introduce Ah-chan.

Ah-chan is the member I’ve been with for the longest time in our band, for almost 10 years, probably? [Note: They probably met in early 2011.]

She’s the life of the party in our band, and she always makes us laugh.

And she has such a pure heart she has an ability to open many other people’s heart quickly.

She practices the drums really a lot every day, which is cool. She’s the pillar of the band.

That’s all.
