Hi, I’m Akane.

O-mei-syu-sama, how are you?

My “Song of the Month” is Summer Drive.

Summer reminds me of the song, so I’ve chosen it for August! It makes me feel nostalgic.

Let’s stay healthy even under the broiling sunshine!

Listening to Summer Drive made me want to do a serving at a rock festival.

I hope we can do servings and shout with you all soon.

I’m looking forward to it!

That’s all from Akane.

Bye-bye!
