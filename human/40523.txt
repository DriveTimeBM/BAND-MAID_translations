O-mei-syu-sama, hello. I’m Akane.

Today I introduce Sai-chan!

We’ve been forming “Goofing-Around Duo” for five or six years, and Sai-chan is my buddy.

We act with a concept of playing to the fullest without using money, such as going to a children’s park and play there [note: 1, 2], or battling on a game we invent.

She has a mature and cool atmosphere but also an extremely childish side. That’s exactly what they call moe by contrast [note: gap].

Please support our vocalist Saiki!

That’s all from Akane.
