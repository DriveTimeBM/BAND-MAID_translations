I’d like to introduce Misa-chan.

Her appearance is like a cool beauty, but her smile she occasionally shows is really cute, and there are probably a lot of o-mei-syu-sama who love her dimples.

And above all, she’s a rocker, she likes drinking, and loves music too, so she’s a bassist I respect a lot from the bottom of my heart.
