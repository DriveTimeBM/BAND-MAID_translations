How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

Today I’d like to brew a pour-over coffee! [Note: Japanese “hand drip” coffee.]

Now, I’d like to start brewing coffee.

I’ve already poured a little hot water, but first, pour hot water at the center slowly like falling drops.

Also, be careful not to pour water on the filter directly.

Then, let it steam for around 30 seconds.

I’ve let it steam.

OK. Then, after that, pour water like drawing the digit “9” [note: originally the hiragana “の”, which means a rotational movement ↻ from the center to the outside].

And it’s important to have different paces, so at first enjoy seeing coffee dripping little by little with aroma♥

Ah, it smells heavenly♥

It’s so good.

Also, off-notes [note: subtle odd flavors] seem to come out if you pour water directly on the filter, so keep pouring while avoiding the filter as much as possible.

It’s very difficult to record this and pour water and talk at the same time.

Dripping and dripping… I’m sure I’ll be fast-forwarded.

Today’s coffee bean is Mandheling of Indonesia.

It takes around three minutes to brew a cup of coffee.

And it depends on the dripping pace, I mean the coffee’s dripping pace, so keep pouring water for around three minutes per one cup of coffee, which is a rough guideline.

Then, around a minute and a half has passed, and the cup is probably one third to a half full, and from now on, stop pouring in drops and pour a lot of hot water like waterfalls.

“9”. “9”. Draw “9”.

Today’s coffee beans have been aged for two weeks, so I think they will give quite a rich flavor.

They are dark roast so they have a little less caffeine. [Note: dark roast beans have less caffeine per volume.]

This is a teacup called Wedgwood.

It’s my favorite♥

I make a cup of coffee always in the morning and in the afternoon.

It’s ready!

Now I’ll drink it!

Ahhh! It tastes so good♥

See you soon.
