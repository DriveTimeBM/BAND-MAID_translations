Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

Spring, summer, fall, winter, and when I realized, it’s already December, and in the last month of the year, I’ve chosen Rinne for my “Song of the Month”.

I’d like to play this song while headbanging with you all at in-person servings next year for sure, po.

This is a beautifully shot picture of me riding a horse, po.

Let’s overcome the cold winter together toward spring, po!

Well then, bye-bye kuruppo!
