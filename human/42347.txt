00:10 Miku: Welcome back home, o-mei-syu-sama, kuruppo! I’m Miku Kobato, po.

00:15 Saiki: I’m Saiki, the vocalist.

00:17 Kanami: I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

00:19 Akane: I’m Akane, the drummer.

00:20 Misa: I’m Misa, the bassist.

00:22 Miku: Now, this time too, we’re recording the radio show remotely, po. This is the second episode of Radio for O-mei-syu-sama, po!

00:32 Others: Yay!!

00:35 Miku: You might not be able to hear well because of the remote recording, but please enjoy this, po!

00:43 Miku: Well, everyone, how was our first episode? You Band-Maid members, how was it, po?

00:48 Kanami: It was fun!

00:50 Misa: It was fun. I was drinking then.

00:52 Miku: Was it fun, po? Oh, Misa-chan, today you don’t drink, do you, po?

00:55 Misa: I’m drinking!

00:56 Miku: Oh, you’re drinking, po.

00:56 Kanami: What, are you drinking?

00:58 Others: (laughs)

00:59 Miku: I thought you weren’t drinking because I couldn’t see your glass, but you’ve already started, po.

01:03 Saiki: What drink today?

01:03 Miku: What do you drink today, po?

01:05 Misa: Today I drink whiskey and soda of Suntory Kakubin.

01:09 Saiki: A stable choice.

01:11 Others: (laughs)

01:14 Miku: So, I hope our masters and princesses and o-mei-syu-sama enjoyed the first episode, po.

01:21 Miku: In this second episode, our themes are: the job I wanted to do when I was small, and what kind of child I was when I was small, po.

01:33 Kanami: Whoa!

01:34 Akane: Clap clap clap.

01:35 Others: (applause)

01:36 Miku: Clap clap clap, po. Last time we talked about our first impression of each other, po, right?

01:44 Miku: This time we members would like to dig further into ourselves, po. I’ll be glad if we can talk about what kind of child each of us was, po.

01:58 Miku: On our childhood. So, who goes first, po?

02:04 Miku: …Nobody raises a hand (laughs).

02:06 Others: (laughs)

02:07 Kanami: Well, OK, I’ll go first, because I’m probably exactly what all of you will think about me.

02:15 Miku: Yeah!

02:17 Kanami: Yes. When I, Mincho, was small, I wanted to be a cake maker!

02:25 Akane: You look so.

02:26 Misa: You look so.

02:27 Others: (laughs)

02:28 Miku: Ah-chan, you guessed it right, po. When we were talking, you were guessing it right, po.

02:35 Akane: I guessed it right.

02:37 Kanami: You guessed it right.

02:40 Miku: You certainly look so, po.

02:43 Kanami: I’m often said so.

02:46 Miku: You always meet our expectations, po.

02:48 Saiki: [Note: I can’t hear well.]

02:54 Kanami: When I was in elementary school and junior high school [note: 1st to 9th grades], um, I wanted to be a patissier, so I was quite into making cakes and sweets.

03:05 Miku: Uh-huh!

03:07 Kanami: Then, when I started the guitar, I quit it completely.

03:14 Miku: So your interest went to the guitar, po.

03:16 Kanami: Yes, I thought if I had time to make sweets I’d rather play the guitar.

03:24 Kanami: But recently, I often enjoy making sweets at home under the stay-at-home request, remembering my childhood.

03:34 Miku: You uploaded pictures before, po.

03:37 Kanami: Right.

03:39 Miku: Po. I saw them, po. Mincho, were you the type who gets aggressive once you’re turned on since you were small, po?

03:46 Kanami: Nope, when I was a kid, um… I lived a life of avoiding the spotlight as much as possible.

03:54 Others: (laughs)

03:58 Miku: You lived such a life, po (laughs).

03:59 Kanami: I’d lived a life of avoiding standing out as much as possible.

04:05 Others: Uh-huh.

04:07 Kanami: Then, when I started the guitar, I got to want to stand out, suddenly.

04:11 Others: (laughs)

04:14 Miku: What you saved in yourself might have come out, po, right?

04:17 Kanami: Was that so? I started the guitar, and I did concerts in the school courtyard in annual school festivals, wearing a maid outfit back then. She lived a tranquil life in her childhood before she got to want to stand out. [Note: she jokingly speaks in the third person.]

04:47 Miku: But didn’t you listen to Santana even if you were quiet, po?

04:51 Kanami: I began to listen to Santana after I started the guitar.

04:54 Miku: Oh did you, po.

04:56 Kanami: Yes, yes, there was a CD in my house.

04:59 Miku: I see, po.

05:00 Kanami: Yes. That’s all. We’ve just listened to Mincho’s… whatchamacallit when she was small!

05:09 Miku: Whatchamacallit (laughs).

05:10 Misa: Whatchamacallit (laughs).

05:10 Akane: A cake maker.

05:11 Miku: Then who goes next, po? Ah-chan.

05:17 Miku: Ah-chan, what did you want to be when you were small, po?

05:20 Akane: I was the same and didn’t change at all from my kindergarten to my third grade in high school. I wanted to be a nursery school teacher.

05:36 Saiki: Too early.

05:38 Miku: Do you mean you wanted to take care of small kids when you were a small kid, po?

05:44 Akane: I’d taken care of kids in my neighborhood since I was small…

05:47 Miku: Oh, I see, po.

05:49 Akane: Yes, I have an elder brother but no younger brother or sister, so it was kind of fun to take care of younger kids. It’s not exactly my maternal instinct (laughs).

06:03 Saiki: Too early. Your maternal instinct.

06:04 Kanami: Did you have it when you were that small?

06:05 Miku: Your maternal instinct bloomed too early, po.

06:08 Akane: I took care of all kids, and I was glad they loved me, so I’d wanted to be a nursery school teacher since then. I was also planning to go to a nursery school teacher’s course when I was in high school, but when I realized, I was playing the drums (laughs).

06:23 Others: (laughs)

06:25 Miku: What was that, po? What did you realize, po?

06:28 Akane: When I was in the third grade in high school, I suddenly wanted to be a hairdresser, and I worked part-time in a beauty salon, but except for that mystery year where I wanted to be a hairdresser, I’d always wanted to be a nursery school teacher.

06:44 Kanami: The “mystery year” is funny (laughs).

06:46 Akane: Yes, that was a mystery year.

06:48 Miku: That was a mystery year for sure, po.

06:50 Akane: So, I’d always wanted to be a nursery school teacher.

06:51 Miku: Ah-chan, when you were small, what kind of child were you?

06:55 Akane: I haven’t changed.

06:56 Saiki: A bad girl. You were a bad girl [note: yankī in Japanese].

06:58 Miku: A bad girl.

06:59 Akane: Since I was small.

07:00 Miku: Were you a bad girl?

07:01 Akane: Well, I think I was bad, probably.

07:04 Others: (laughs)

07:05 Saiki: Well, Ah-chan, your mom said you were a bad kid or something, right?

07:12 Akane: She said so. I shut myself up in a restroom because I hated to go to my kindergarten. In the kindergarten’s restroom.

07:17 Saiki: Yes, yes!

07:19 Akane: I shut myself up.

07:20 Miku: What was that, po?

07:25 Akane: Oh, however, I haven’t done anything like bullying others at all.

07:29 Miku: So, do you mean you didn’t do things like that and you just didn’t want to go to kindergarten, po?

07:34 Akane: I hated to go to kindergarten so much I often escaped and played with mud.

07:38 Kanami: Yes, that’s what I heard. Your escape.

07:41 Akane: I sometimes played with mud and then just ran away to home, covered with mud.

07:44 Others: (laughs)

07:46 Akane: Then the kindergarten bus came to my house to pick me up.

07:50 Miku: You were cool, po. You were a VIP.

07:53 Akane: I wasn’t a VIP (laughs).

07:54 Others: (laughs)

07:59 Akane: I had such a habit of running away.

08:03 Miku: The habit of running away. I, Kobato, also had it, po.

08:06 Akane: Oh did you?

08:07 Miku: Yes, the same, I had it, po. I lived in an apartment when I was small, and at moments when my mom was hanging out the laundry and took her eyes off me, I loved to sneak out of my house and play at the stairs, po.

08:30 Kanami: How old were you then?

08:32 Miku: Well, I was probably four.

08:35 Kanami: Wow. It’s amazing you remember when you were that small.

08:38 Miku: I remember only that, po. No other memories actually, po. So, when I was four or five, I was playing at the outside stairs and I slipped and fell from the head to the concrete step, po.

08:51 Akane: You often do it even now, right?

08:55 Misa: You haven’t changed, right?

08:56 Kanami: Are you talking about a recent accident?

08:57 Miku: That’s not a recent one, po!

08:58 Others: (laughs)

09:02 Miku: My mother didn’t know I went out, po. When she went back to the room, nobody was there, and she heard someone crying outside, so she ran out and found me with a huge bump just above the eye.

09:19 Misa: That was dangerous.

09:21 Miku: I was like “Waaaah! I fell!” (laughs) She took me to the hospital immediately, po.

09:30 Akane: She must have been scared.

09:33 Miku: I became more careful after that, po.

09:36 Akane: Not to cause trouble.

09:38 Miku: Right, I remember that clearly, po.

09:42 Kanami: Speaking of that, Kobato, what did you want to be recently, no, I mean, when you were small?

09:49 Miku: Recently? (laughs)

09:50 Saiki: What do you want to be recently? (laughs)

09:51 Others: (laughs)

09:54 Miku: Well, it’s rather hard to answer what I want to be recently, po.

10:00 Kanami: I mean what you wanted to be when you were small (laughs).

10:03 Miku: When I was small… I had various things I wanted to be. You might get mad if I say this, but I first remembered I wanted to be Sailor Moon, po.

10:12 Misa: Oh!

10:13 Miku: Yes, I wanted to be Sailor Moon, po.

10:17 Akane: You know, you have twintails now.

10:19 Miku: Oh, you’re right!

10:23 Kanami: I didn’t know your twintails came from there.

10:26 Saiki: Do you still want to be her?

10:28 Miku: Wait, that might be the reason why I have a cat, po.

10:31 Akane: Nice. His color is different though.

10:34 Saiki: So you wanted to be Sailor Moon.

10:37 Miku: Now and back then. I want to be Sailor Moon now and back then.

10:43 Miku: Well, what remains? I had various things I wanted to be. I wanted to be a florist in some period, and I also wanted to be a wagashi maker in some other period.

10:55 Misa: You were mature. [Note: Japanese people eat wagashi, or Japanese traditional sweets, usually with green tea, and small kids generally don’t like them so much.]

10:59 Kanami: You didn’t want to be a cake maker.

11:01 Miku: I was really into wagashi, po, when I was in elementary school.

11:04 Akane: Cool.

11:07 Miku: That’s why I wanted to be a wagashi maker, po.

11:10 Akane: I see.

11:12 Miku: Sai-chan, how about you? Didn’t you want to be Sailor Moon?

11:16 Saiki: I’ve never thought so. That’s shameless.

11:19 Others: (laughs)

11:20 Miku: “Shameless” (laughs).

11:21 Kanami: You respect her.

11:23 Saiki: I’ve never thought of Sailor Moon like that.

11:26 Miku: I’m sorry, po.

11:28 Akane: You’re shameless (laughs).

11:30 Saiki: What did I want to be? I probably didn’t have an idea in particular.

11:37 Kanami: “Shameless”. That’s so funny.

11:41 Saiki: My mother told me it would be good for me to become a nursery school teacher.

11:47 Miku: Uh-huh!

11:48 Akane: You were the same as me.

11:49 Kanami: Uh-h-h-h-huh-h-h-h-h. [Note: her voice slows down because of a network error.]

11:51 Others: (laughs)

11:55 Saiki: That was so long.

11:57 Miku: Kanami’s “uh-huh” was very long, po, just now.

12:02 Misa: I’m dead (laughs). I died laughing (laughs).

12:05 Miku: Mincho-chan is frozen, po.

12:08 Akane: Uh-h-h-h-huh-h-h-h-h. [Note: she imitates Kanami’s voice.]

12:14 Miku: That was a wonder you can see only on remote meetings, po.

12:20 Saiki: That’s insane.

12:21 Miku: Nice timing.

12:23 Saiki: Can I go on now?

12:24 Akane: Go ahead please.

12:26 Saiki: Well, in spite of my look, I was liked by small kids.

12:34 Miku: You don’t need “in spite of my look”, po.

12:37 Others: (laughs)

12:38 Saiki: My atmosphere hasn’t changed since I was small. I was liked by small kids when I was a kid.

12:50 Miku: Uh-huh.

12:51 Saiki: I played with small kids, and my mother said I should be a nursery school teacher.

13:03 Saiki: I just thought it might be good, without thinking deeply. Actually I wanted to be a model or a singer for long.

13:15 Kanami: Fantastic. Recently I found Sai-chan is really liked by small kids. May I talk about that? Well, I showed a video of Sai-chan to my nephew, at my elder sister’s, and he extremely enjoyed watching it.

13:37 Others: (laughs)

13:38 Miku: Kanami-chan, isn’t that, um, because he has your blood, po? I mean your family’s blood.

13:46 Miku: Isn’t that your blood has too much power to love Sai-chan, po?

13:50 Saiki: Funny.

13:51 Kanami: He was in a bad mood, but when I showed him a video where she says “Kanami-chan”, he grinned for some reason.

13:56 Others: (laughs)

13:58 Kanami: I told about it to Sai-chan, and she said she’s popular with small kids.

14:09 Kanami: You’ve been really popular since you were small, also with small kids.

14:14 Saiki: For some reason.

14:17 Saiki: They wanted me to hug them.

14:20 Kanami: They are cute!

14:22 Miku: You were very popular, po.

14:25 Saiki: Right, I thought they were cute.

14:28 Kanami: But you were popular only with boys, weren’t you?

14:30 Saiki: Oh yes, I was very popular with boys.

14:34 Miku: I expected that, you haven’t changed, po. [Note: She unintentionally said kawaran po, a dialectal form with “po”, which sounds funny.]

14:39 Saiki: Kawaran po? (laughs)

14:40 Others: (laughs)

14:43 Miku: Kawaran po.

14:45 Saiki: Kawaran po (laughs). No, that’s not the case.

14:48 Miku: Misa-chan, how about you?

14:50 Misa: When I was in kindergarten, I was a tomboy more energetic than boys. I was cheerful, it seems.

15:03 Miku: “It seems.” What did you want to be, po?

15:08 Misa: The same as Kobato.

15:10 Miku: Oh really? Sailor Moon?

15:12 Misa: Sailor Moon.

15:13 Kanami: I see why you said “oh” loud a little while ago.

15:16 Others: (laughs)

15:19 Misa: You noticed it well (laughs). Right, I said “oh”.

15:26 Miku: You said so, po.

15:27 Saiki: It’s amazing you are the same.

15:31 Miku: Isn’t it rare to be the same like this?

15:35 Misa: Well, when I was three, my mother gave me a birthday present. It was some ticket that says I can become Sailor Moon when I turn 14.

15:47 Misa: It was an official one from Sailor Moon with a picture of Sailor Moon.

15:53 Kanami: Uh-huh.

15:55 Miku: I didn’t know there’s such a thing.

15:56 Misa: Yes. And I’ve heard I’d put it in the back of my desk for long.

15:59 Miku: Wow, you were cute, po.

16:00 Misa: Then I turned 14, and I still had it, probably. My mother said to me, “Now you can be Sailor Moon. What will you do?” and I answered, “No way.”

16:13 Others: (laughs)

16:16 Misa: I was realistic. My mother had planned to say it for long.

16:22 Miku: I see, that’s too long. Your mother plans too far, po.

16:26 Others: (laughs)

16:27 Kanami: This is fun.

16:31 Misa: I really wanted to be Sailor Moon back then.

16:35 Akane: You were cute. That’s heart-warming.

16:39 Saiki: Kobato still wants to be her.

16:41 Akane: Even now.

16:42 Miku: Yeah.

16:43 Saiki: Kobato, you still want to be her.

16:46 Miku: I have twintails for sure.

16:47 Akane: You’re shameless.

16:48 Miku: I’m shameless. I’m sorry, po.

16:53 Kanami: Can you be her even if you are 810 years old? Is it OK to be 810 years old?

16:58 Miku: I don’t know well actually, po. I’ve already become her, po. But I can’t punish in the name of the moon.

17:03 Akane: But okyuji (“serving”) and oshioki (“punishment”) somewhat sound similar.

17:07 Miku: Well, we’ve found how great Sailor Moon is, po.

17:11 Saiki: She’s so popular.

17:12 Miku: She’s so popular as expected. We share many things. Ah-chan and Sai-chan were close.

17:23 Akane: Right.

17:24 Saiki: Right.

17:26 Miku: And I was also close [note: to Misa]. Only Kanami-chan was just as expected.

17:32 Others: (laughs)

17:35 Saiki: She always meets our expectations.

17:37 Miku: Kanami-chan met our expectations, po.

17:40 Akane: And Misa was a tomboy.

17:43 Miku: Right. I want to see how Misa was a tomboy, po.

17:48 Misa: I was well-known for being cheerful.

17:56 Miku: Uh-huh. Please show us a picture if you have.

17:59 Kanami: (strange voice) [Note: there is a network error again.]

18:01 Others: (laughs)

18:06 Miku: Kanami-chan is broken, po!

18:13 Kanami: (strange voice)

18:19 Others: (laughs)

18:23 Misa: Don’t talk anymore (laughs).

18:24 Miku: Stop it please, po! (laughs) Kanami-chan is broken, po.

18:30 Saiki: What?

18:32 Misa: Are you OK? Now?

18:35 Miku: Are you all right?

18:37 Akane: Come back.

18:40 Kanami: (strange voice)

18:41 Others: (laughs)

18:45 Akane: Kanami-chan is frozen.

18:47 Miku: Kanami-chan is frozen, po.

18:49 Kanami: Did I freeze?

18:51 Miku: Ah, you’re back, po! That’s good, po. Now that Kanami-chan is back and this is a radio show, we’d like you to listen to a song too, po.

19:04 Miku: In the first episode, Ah-chan… Akane selected a song for us, and in this second episode, I’d like to let a tomboy we can hardly imagine, Misa-chan, select a song, po.

19:23 Misa: Even now, I’m a tomboy when I’m drunk.

19:25 Others: (laughs)

19:28 Saiki: You’re a tomboy when you get drunk.

19:32 Akane: You run around very often.

19:34 Saiki: You run a lot.

19:35 Miku: Like, “Waaaa”.

19:37 Misa: I’m sorry (laughs).

19:39 Miku: You even apologized. Please select a song, po.

19:44 Misa: Well, I want to make it a riddle.

19:48 Miku: Po.

19:49 Kanami: Your way of saying is funny.

19:52 Saiki: Like, “A pan [note: “bread” in Japanese] that is not a pan”?

19:56 Kanami: A frying pan!

19:57 Misa: With C…

20:00 Misa: OK? An album that begins with C, a song that begins with D.

20:06 Saiki: Conqueror.

20:08 Misa: No. An album that begins with C…

20:12 Akane: Why no? Isn’t it Conqueror?

20:13 Miku: No? An album that begins with C is Conqueror…

20:16 Saiki: That must be Conqueror.

20:17 Others: (laughs)

20:19 Saiki: Why did you say “no”?

20:22 Misa: What? Did I say so?

20:26 Others: (laughs)

20:29 Akane: Your riddle level is too low!

20:33 Misa: This is my first riddle.

20:35 Others: (laughs)

20:37 Misa: We play a unison in the B-melody [note: second half of the main verse].

20:41 Akane: I know it.

20:42 Misa: What is it?

20:43 Saiki: You can guess it by “unison”.

20:44 Akane: I know it.

20:45 Misa: A unison of the vocals, the guitar and the bass.

20:48 Akane: I know it. I completely know it.

20:52 Saiki: It’s too clear. You gave too many hints.

20:57 Misa: Now I explain. Please listen to Dilemma.

(Dilemma)

23:56 Miku: So, it’s about time to say goodbye. O-mei-syu-sama, how was that, po? Please tell us themes you want to listen to or you want to know, po. That’s all from Band-Maid, po. Bye-bye kuruppo!

24:09 Others: Bye-bye!
