00:00 Hi, I’m Misa.

00:01 This time, in my fifth episode, I’ll do a cooking video for the first time in a while.

00:06 Today I’ll make chicken karaage!

00:09 First, I’d like to drink.

00:20 [Caption] Beer is the best, after all.

00:22 Let’s drink.

00:29 Ahh. Whew.

00:32 So, today I prepared chicken thighs and gizzards.

00:38 Now, I’d like to coat each piece with potato starch.

00:43 Today I don’t use seasoning.

00:44 Coat with starch like this.

00:48 Now, I’d like to deep-fry them.

01:05 A nice sound!

01:07 How is it? Can you hear it?

01:10 A nice sound.

01:13 I turned them over.

01:17 They’re now white. Beautiful.

01:22 Let’s move on to gizzards.

01:33 That’s a nice sound.

01:35 Nice.

01:36 I use a cast iron frying pan this time, so I think I can fry them well.

01:42 Now they are ready!

01:44 This is ponzu [note: soy sauce with citrus] with momiji-oroshi [note: grated daikon with chili pepper].

01:49 These are fried gizzards and chicken thighs.

01:52 Now, let’s eat.

02:03 Will you be able to hear the sound?

02:19 Mmm, delicious!

02:22 Mmm!

02:25 Delicious. This is awesome.

02:29 Let’s put it aside for a while and move on to gizzard.

02:43 Can you hear it?

02:47 Delicious!

02:49 Well then, everyone, please give them a try.

02:52 Bye!
