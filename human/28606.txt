01:47 Hatoko: Let’s draw it together.

01:49 Akatsuki: I will try love fortune-telling.

01:52 Akatsuki: I will try it.

01:53 Akatsuki: I always get “Expected person will not come”.

01:57 Akatsuki: But I always get great luck on work.

02:01 Akatsuki: So that’s true.

02:02 Hatoko: What’s that? I wanna see it!

02:03 Clerk: If you touch it like this, the lights turn on like this, and release your hands when all are on. Then the number appears at the center.

02:09 Staff member: I see.

02:10 Akatsuki: When should I concentrate on my wish?

02:13 Akatsuki: While doing this.

02:16 Akatsuki: Here I go.

02:19 [Caption] Akatsuki: Whew (concentration)

02:23 Akatsuki: I want to be happy.

02:25 Hatoko: You’re so serious.

02:26 Akatsuki: I want to be loved.

02:33 Hatoko: It stopped, po.

02:34 Clerk: No. 9.

02:44 Hatoko: It’s a Middle Blessing, po!

02:47 Akatsuki: “The more you think of your lover, the more you spin your wheels.”

02:51 Hatoko: It’s not so good, po.

02:56 Akatsuki: “Don’t you push your feelings on your lover too much?”

03:01 Akatsuki: “Matchmaking: Consult with a person older than you and decide.”

03:03 Akatsuki: There are so many people older than me here.

03:06 Akatsuki: All of them are older than me.

03:08 Akatsuki: It says a Taurus will suit me.

03:10 Akatsuki: A person from Kansai or Hokuriku (will suit me).

03:14 Akatsuki: In addition, “Open spaces such as parks are lucky.” I think I’ll wait in a park.

03:18 Fujiki: You like parks, right?

03:19 Akatsuki: Yeah, I love them.

03:20 Akatsuki: “Spend time with a calm heart like an ocean.”

03:39 [Caption] Kanoemi called her with the wrong name and they are arguing.

03:39 Hatoko: I’m Hatoko, po.

03:41 Kanoemi: Who’s Kobato?

03:43 Hatoko: Who’s that, po? I’m Hatoko. [Note: in the Maiko dialect.]

03:46 Kanoemi: Oh, you’re Hatoko. Who is Kobato?

03:50 Hatoko: I don’t know.

03:51 Kanoemi: Someone I don’t know.

03:53 Hatoko: Who is that? [Note: in the Maiko dialect.]

03:55 Hatoko: I don’t know. I’m Hatoko. [Note: in the Maiko dialect.]

04:00 Kanoemi: She got mad.

04:06 Akatsuki: I thought they were frozen, so I was surprised!

04:11 Akatsuki: It’s sooo cold.

04:51 Hatoko: (laughs) She’s gazing us, po.

04:54 Akatsuki: Whoa, I’m scared! (laughs) [Note: with a scary music.]

05:53 Kanoemi: … off guard just now.

05:55 Fujiki: Yeah, like, “This was not written” (laughs).

05:58 All: (laughs)

05:59 Fujiki: Like, “Why this?”

06:01 Fujiki: I was really stretching my legs like this (laughs).

06:03 Hatoko: You sat with your legs stretched out, po, absolutely. [Note: bad manners in kimono.]

06:07 Hatoko: Happy birthday, po.

06:07 Fujiki: Thank you very much.

06:09 Hatoko: This is your cake, po.


Note on the game of Glico:

As you know, in rock paper scissors, each player throws one of the three hands, namely rock, paper, and scissors, where rock defeats scissors, scissors defeats paper, and paper defeats rock. If all the players throw the same hand, or at least one player throws each of the three hands (in the case of three players or more), it’s a draw, and they play a next turn immediately.

In the children’s game of Glico, often played on stairs where you can count steps, you play rock paper scissors as usual, and the winner advances according to their winning hand, based on the number of letters (not syllables):

Hand	Japanese name	Name in Glico	Letters	Steps gained
Rock	Gū	Glico	グリコ	3
Paper	Pā	Pineapple	パイナップル	6
Scissors	Choki	Chocolate	チョコレート	6
Glico is named after the caramel candy well-known for the logo of a running man. If you win with paper, you gain 6 steps forward. The first one to reach the end of stairs wins. The point is, rock gives you only 3 steps while paper and scissors give you 6 steps. So, rock clearly looks like a bad option, and since scissors defeats paper, you are naturally tempted to throw scissors… and you would be surprised your opponent throws rock by guessing your thoughts.
