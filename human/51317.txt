Kuruppo! Iâ€™m Kobato, po!

My favorite way to spend at-home time is to take a looong bath, po.

I bring drinking water and my iPad to the bathroom and I think of lyrics or watch movies or dramas or listen to music, po.

I use various bath salts and fragrances depending on my mood, po.

Moreover, I bought a bath pillow, so I spend my time comfortably with it, po.

What kind of fragrance do you like, po?

Bye-bye, po!
