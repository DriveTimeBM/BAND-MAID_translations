I’m Akane.

The character that represents my goal of this year is “進” [note: “go forward”].

I’ve chosen the character “進” with a strong determination to progress, to evolve, and to move forward, as an individual and as a band.

Let’s look forward and keep going step by step with hope together.

I’ll do my best! Yeah!

That’s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
