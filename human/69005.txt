Hi, I’m Misa.

My “Song of the Month” is Awkward.

I listened to it for the first time in a while and thought it’s a good song, so I chose it.

Me, Kanami, and Sai-chan played it at the Christmas acoustic concert last year, right?

I already even feel nostalgic.

Time flies. It’s already February, right?

Cold days continue, but everyone, please take care of yourselves not to catch a cold.

One twelfth of this year has already passed. Time flies a little too fast.

Well then, everyone, bye-bye.
