Kuruppo! O-mei-syu-sama, I’m Miku Kobato, po!

This time, my bandmates are introducing me to you, po.

What?! What are they going to say about me, po?

Probably they will say “a strange pigeon” or “a middle-aged man inside!”, po.

My heart is throbbing! I’m looking forward to it, po!

O-mei-syu-sama, what do you think about me, po?

Please continue to support me, po.

That’s all from Kobato. Bye-bye, po!
