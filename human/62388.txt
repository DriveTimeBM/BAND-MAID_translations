Hi, I’m Akane.

It rained a lot in September, didn’t it?

The other day, I got caught in a sudden downpour and soaked to the skin on my way home!

Speaking of being soaked, there was an MV we shot in heavy rain, but do you masters and princesses know which song was that?

Yes, the right answer is Warning!

I extremely love the MV, so please watch it a lot.

The Okyu-ji video of Warning! is also awesome, so please watch it too!

Well then, that’s all from Akane.

Bye-bye!
