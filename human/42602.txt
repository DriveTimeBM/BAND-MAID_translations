Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

Now, I introduce Misa this time, po.

Misa-chan is just cute, po!

She’s very shy, and she has soft baby-like cheeks, po.

She keeps laughing when something strikes her sense of humor, po.

She’s a really pure girl, po.

We members sometimes watch over her as if we were her parents, po.

Misa loves drinking and I love her, po.

Well, bye-bye kuruppo!
