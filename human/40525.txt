Kuruppo! I’m Miku Kobato, po.

This time I introduce Sai-chan, po.

I think Sai-chan is, in short, Her Majesty the Queen in a very good sense who goes well with the phrase “I alone am the honored one”, po.

If I say only that, she might get mad at me, so I explain it clearly, po.

She loves sneakers, Sailor Moon, Shinkansen, and beer, and she is strict with herself when she works out, po.

While she charms masters and princesses with her coolness in servings, she sometimes sparkles with cuteness offstage, and everyone is enchanted by her contrast, po.

That’s my theory that Sai-chan is unbeatable, po.

Now, it’s time to end. Bye-bye, po!
