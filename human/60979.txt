Hello, I’m Misa.

The “Song of the Month”, um, what should I choose?…

Um, the number of COVID infections is increasing again, and we are supposed to avoid going out unnecessarily, so I choose this song that would lift you up even in this situation, DICE.

I hope a world where we can have concerts without worry will come soon.

Well, bye-bye.
