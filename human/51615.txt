O-mei-syu-sama, hi, I’m Saiki.

If I express my goal of this year with a single character, it will be “楽” [note: “comfort”, ”enjoyment”].

Even in this situation, I’d like to comfortably enjoy performing music, without worrying too much.

I’m looking forward to giving our music to you o-mei-syu-sama again.

Goodbye.
