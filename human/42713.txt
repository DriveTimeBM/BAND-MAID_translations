Hello, I’m Misa.

This time they introduce me to you, so, umm, what do they say about me?

I guess they say I like drinking and I’m like a child and laugh a lot when I get drunk.

What do they say? I hope they don’t say funny things about me (laughs).

This kind of program is fun, isn’t it?

So, everyone, when you spend time while taking care of yourself, enjoy listening to our web contents like these.

I’m not good at talking, but please continue to support me.

Bye. That’s all from Misa.
