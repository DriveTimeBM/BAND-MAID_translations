Yoo-hoo! I’m Misa.

As for my goal of this year, um, if I pick one character for it, it will be “創” [note: “create”].

I’ve chosen it because I want to keep creating music and I want to create songs.

I’ll live my life this year with that as my goal.

This year I’ll probably have to spend a lot of time at home like before, so I also want to do my best to cook more frequently.

Well, I’m looking forward to seeing you this year too!

Bye-bye!
