00:00 How are you, masters and princesses? I’m Kanami, the guitarist!

00:05 Well, today! Um, last time, I talked about my memories by looking at past pictures, and many of you said it was fun, so this time too, I’d like to look back on memories together by looking at various pictures!

00:29 So, today I dug out some pictures from 2016.

00:33 I’ve forgotten many things, but I’d like to look back at pictures together, and I’d like to look at our… kind of histories? that some of you masters and princesses might hear for the first time like “Oh, I didn’t know that”.

00:54 I’ll open them one by one on my computer!

00:57 The first one is this.

01:00 It’s a picture of us holding tulips, um, when we went abroad for the first time.

01:07 We were invited to an event named Sakura-Con, and that allowed us to go abroad for the first time.

01:17 This is Seattle.

01:20 We went to Seattle, and we also filmed quite a lot of materials of the MV of Before Yesterday there and edited them in Japan, so if you haven’t watched the MV of Before Yesterday, it would be nice to watch it.

01:41 Moreover, in that year, 2016, we made a major-label debut with the first album Brand New MAID!

01:51 Back then, we were saying “This is wonderful!”, but actually I remember I didn’t really feel we made a major-label debut.

02:04 That said, each of us were working toward a major-label debut even before forming Band-Maid, so I’m proud to have made a major-label debut in this band!

02:17 And in that year, we Band-Maid went on the Brand New MAID release tour.

02:25 It was… It was our first time going on a nationwide tour, and we went to so many places.

02:34 We went to, um, around 20 places, from July to October.

02:42 We went to various places and ate various delicious foods there, and I think we really strengthened our bond by going around together in that year.

02:57 And the next picture is crab.

03:01 You might wonder why it’s crab, but there was a reason. Actually, the first country of our world tour was Mexico, and we arrived at the airport to fly to Mexico in the night? in the middle of the night, I think.

03:21 It’s a far country, so we were all excited when we arrived at the airport, and we got fired up like “Here we go!”

03:30 Then, trouble occurred, though I don’t quite remember, maybe double booking? Anyway we couldn’t get on the plane.

03:39 We were like “What? Can’t we fly to Mexico today?” so we decided to eat something delicious for the time being and sleep at a hotel and fly there next day. This is a picture of the memory of eating so much crab (laughs).

03:58 I remember Sai-chan and Kobato in particular kept eating lots and lots of crab, like, how many buckets of crab did they eat? (laughs)

04:10 Next, as you see in this picture, we arrived safely in Mexico!

04:19 Well, um, speaking of Mexico, I thought it’s the most powerful country I’ve ever visited.

04:32 It was really powerful when we went there for the first time as well as when we went there recently, because, um, their voices were loud, and they kept chanting “Band-Maid” outside from more than one hour before the start.

04:53 “What?” Initially we were like “What? What? What happened to them? We haven’t started yet but why?” and we were all nervous, but we found it’s a country where people get excited even before the start.

05:09 In Mexico, foods are really delicious and people are all nice. I love it.

05:18 The next picture is this. In a car.

05:22 Well, in our first world tour, we went around many countries in a single van.

05:33 There was only a van, so we also had to put all our equipment in it, and it had six seats in the back, and the six of us including the manager sat there, grasping the knees, because the floor was full of equipment, and we went around many countries, sitting like that for 8 hours or so (laughs).

06:00 I think it was really rough, but I have so many fun memories maybe because we are good friends, and even now we talk like “At that time Kobato was like this and that”, so, um, even though we had a hard time, we had a lot of fun in the end. This picture of the van reminds me of that.

06:33 It was our first world tour, and we were all moved to find there were masters and princesses in the first place, like “This many people know about us overseas!”

06:46 Moreover, there were so many people working hard to learn Japanese that I got teary-eyed.

06:55 It’s still the same, but I’m feeling you masters and princesses are getting better and better at Japanese year by year.

07:07 I would be happy if we could make you love Japanese culture, the Japanese language, and Japan itself through us Band-Maid.

07:23 The next is a picture of the serving at Shimokitazawa Garden.

07:30 Well, we went on the world tour, um, at Mexico, London, Cologne, Hamburg, Paris, Warsaw? and returned to Japan once, in order to do this serving at Shimokitazawa.

07:48 Well, we went on the nationwide tour, um, in Japan, and after finishing it, we went on the overseas tour World Series, and then we got a chance to do an additional performance and we were asked when to do, and our schedule only allowed that day, so we returned to Japan once and did the serving at Garden at went back on the overseas tour. I remember it was a sche… such a tight and hard schedule.

08:22 Howerver, I’m really grateful of being able to do an additional performance.

08:28 Since we got the tickets sold out, we wanted to do it for masters and princesses who couldn’t come to see us, and we realized the number of our masters and princesses increased quite a lot in 2016.

08:53 In the beginning, there was literally only one person or a few people who came to see us, so we were absolutely happy, we were glad we were able to do an additional performance.

09:13 The next picture is when we did a serving at Hong Kong.

09:18 After finishing the additional serving, I mean, after finishing the serving of the additional performance, we flew to Hong Kong within a week and did a serving there.

09:32 We went to Hong Kong for the first time, so we were all nervous, wondering what kind of country it is, but it was like Japan, I mean, it was similar to Japan.

09:46 Foods there, um, are very, um, suit Japanese people’s tastes so much.

09:55 There were a lot of delicious foods.

09:57 At the serving too, I think they got excited in the way Japanese people do.

10:06 We managed to finish the world tour and the nationwide tour like that.

10:13 The next picture is when we appeared in Classic Rock Awards 2016. It brings back memories!

10:22 It was an event literally many legends appeared in, so I thought it was an overwhelming honor for us Band-Maid to appear in it (laughs).

10:36 I was absolutely nervous.

10:38 Well, it was an absolutely inspiring day.

10:44 I couldn’t take my eyes off at any moment on that day.

10:48 We’d like to do our best to appear with such legends again someday!

10:50 The next is a picture when we released YOLO.

11:05 Well, we were making the rounds of stores such as Tower Records.

11:11 We make the rounds of stores also now. We were all really glad about the single release, I mean, our major-label debut single release. I was happy!

11:25 You know, we also make the rounds of promotional displays, and they are so kind to us at any stores.

11:39 Thank you so much all the time (laughs).

11:41 Now, this is the last picture! The last one this time.

11:45 Um, in this picture, uh, my hair is messy, and this is when I purchased a PRS for the first time.

11:56 Well, it was the moment when I changed to PRS, thinking about the direction of Band-Maid, and, um, thinking which sound would be good for us.

12:16 So, I tried various guitars, at instrument shops and the like, and PRS fit me the best.

12:27 I had a kind of intuition that it would be the Band-Maid sound (laughs).

12:35 I had such an intuition, and I was also attracted so much to the material of PRS that seems to stick to my hand, so I decided to use PRS in Band-Maid, and tried a lot of guitars, and finally got this purple guitar.

12:58 I have quite a long relationship with this guitar.

13:01 So, this time, I looked back on Band-Maid in 2016!

13:08 While looking at the pictures, I felt somewhat nostalgic, but I also felt it was recent.

13:19 Everyone, did you enjoy it?

13:23 I would be glad if you enjoyed it (laughs).

13:28 Well, there must be many of you masters and princesses who got to know about us Band-Maid recently. We have been working hard on lots and lots of things with fun like that.

13:45 Now, um, that’s all for Mincho’s Room today.

13:50 Thank you so much for watching!
