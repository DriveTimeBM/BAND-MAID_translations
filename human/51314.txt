Hello, I’m Misa.

Well, this time, I’ll talk about my favorite way to spend at-home time, and when I want to have a fulfilling day, I jump rope to loosen up my body as soon as I get up in the morning.

And immediately after that, I take a half-body bath in the bathtub and then I have breakfast. That feels so good, so everyone, give it a try.

I sometimes go back to sleep after that.

You can have an even more fun day if you drink beer in the daytime and do something you love!

Well, bye-bye!
