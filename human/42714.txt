Hello, I’m Misa.

Everyone, how are you? I’m fine.

This time I’ll introduce Akane, our drummer, and personally, basically, I can’t relax around other people, but strangely I can relax when I’m with Akane.

I think that’s because of Akane’s own character.

Yeah, I’m really relaxed when I’m with her.

She’s on the same wavelength of silly jokes with me, and she’s a fun and kind girl.

Akane, let’s stay the best rhythm section together.

Bye. That’s all from Misa.
