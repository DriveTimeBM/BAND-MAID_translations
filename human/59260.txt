Hi! I’m Akane, the type who eats only sōmen in summer!

That’s why it’s a photo of Ibonoito!

Well, when I was a kid, there were a lot of fun things in summer, like I had a vacation and I went to the pool and festivals with friends, and I had a sense of freedom, so I chose FREEDOM for my “Song of the Month”!

Everyone, please be careful not to get sick from the heat!

See you.
