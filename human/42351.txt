O-mei-syu-sama! I’m Saiki.

Now, I’d like to introduce sneakers also this time, without getting bored.

First, let me show you the box.

This is the box.

It’s black. Do you know this “Nike On Air”?

This Nike On Air is the name of a design contest by Nike to create new Air Max in six cities in the world, and Tokyo was included in Nike On Air, like “Japan, Tokyo”, and this is the pair of sneakers they chose there.

Here they are.

They’re very eccentric, right?

Well, this design, something like a maze, was created based on an image of the Tokyo subway, and, um, this red design on the back, and this red in the inside, and the red letters on the soles stand for the red color of Tokyo Tower, so I’ve heard.

And the left is accented with black lines on a white background, and this one, the right, is accented with white lines on a black background.

The name of the sneakers is Tokyo Maze. It’s written on the soles. “TOKYO MAZE”. It’s cool, right?

And their characteristics are these many things, including shoelaces.

Here, look here, this one is removable with Velcro like this, so you can use, here, which should I use… this one with the name, which looks nice, like this, and you can play with them by customizing them.

These ones, I couldn’t buy them in real time, and you know, there are a lot of sneaker lovers out there, there are so many I often become friends with them like “Oh do you love sneakers?” and one of those friends kindly sold them to me.

They are a couple and the husband said he had bought these sneakers for his wife.

But the wife didn’t like the design and didn’t think they would suit her, and when we talked about that he kindly said he could sell them to me.

I’ve talked about these cute sneakers.

See you next time. Bye-bye!
