O-mei-syu-sama, hi, Iâ€™m Saiki.

My favorite way to spend at-home time is, above all, to do whatever I love, such as singing songs at home and watching movies.

Among the movies I watched recently, The Grand Budapest Hotel was especially funny.

O-mei-syu-sama, please watch it if you are interested.
