Hello, everyone, I’m Misa.

How are you doing lately?

This time, our theme is an introduction of Kobato by each of us.

Well, Kobato is a girl with a narrow forehead and handsome wide shoulders who loves horse racing.

And she is the strongest drinker among us members.

Um, when I drink with her, if I get drunk, she always lends me a shoulder kindly and handsomely.

I think she is a warm and cute woman.

Kobato, I love you.

Bye. That’s all from Misa.
