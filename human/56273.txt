O-mei-syu-sama, good afternoon, good evening, I’m Saiki.

How are you?

Here’s my behind-the-scenes story of “The Day of Maid”. Kobato… um, Cluppo-san appeared as an opening act for us, and she said “my bandmates all watched me, Sai-chan watched me too” [note: at 0:35:06]… but I… couldn’t watch her.

Sorry.

You did a good job. Everyone was excited.
