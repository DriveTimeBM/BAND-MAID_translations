Hi, I’m Misa.

For my “Song of the Month”, I choose Why Why Why.

The reason is that the bass is pretty busy and precise up to the middle, but the chorus is four on the floor and always makes me headbang, which I think is cool.

Do you get it?

I like the feel I get when I reach the chorus after having fun playing the verse.

I love the vocal vibe too.

Everyone, those of you who can play the bass, please play it.

Well, bye-bye.
