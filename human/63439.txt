Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

When I talked with my bandmates about what to choose for my “Song of the Month”, Sai-chan said to me, “It’s your birth month, so why don’t you choose Sayonakidori?”, so I chose it, po.

I think your birthday is a fantastic day that comes to each of you once every year, so I, Kobato, would like to cherish mine regardless of my age, po.

My bandmates and all of you said to me “Happy birthday!”, so I’m so happy, po!

Well then, bye-bye, po!
