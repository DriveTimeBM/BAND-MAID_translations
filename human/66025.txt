How are you?

Time flies and this year is about to end.

Masters and princesses, how will you spend New Year holidays?

Next year, I’d like to do servings in front of you all!

I’d like to go overseas and continue our world domination too.

With that feeling, my “Song of the Month” is DOMINATION!

I wish you masters and princesses that wonderful days will come to you also next year!

That’s all from Kanamincho. Have a happy new year!
