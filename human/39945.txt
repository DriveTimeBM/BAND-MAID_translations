00:10 Miku: Welcome back home, o-mei-syu-sama, kuruppo! I’m Miku Kobato, po.

00:16 Saiki: I’m Saiki.

00:17 Kanami: I’m Kanami.

00:18 Akane: I’m Akane.

00:20 Misa: I’m Misa.

00:21 Miku: Now, this time, the special version of “Voice for O-mei-syu-sama”…

00:26 Others: (applause)

00:27 Miku: The title is “Radio for O-mei-syu-sama”, po.

00:35 Kanami: Oh, this is the first time.

00:36 Miku: Yes it is, po. This time, because of this difficult time, we’re recording the radio show remotely, po.

00:43 Miku: Actually, in this April, we were scheduled to go on a tour of joint concerts, po.

00:50 Kanami: Yes, that’s right. We didn’t announce it though.

00:56 Miku: Right, po, actually. But to our regret we’ve canceled it this time. It’ll be good if we can go on a tour of joint concerts someday, po.

01:06 Akane: I want to do it.

01:07 Saiki: I want to do it.

01:09 Miku: This time, instead of that… it’s too much to say so… we’d like to send our voices to our masters and princesses, po. We give it a try, and you might not be able to hear well, but please enjoy this, po.

01:25 Kanami: Yay yay!

01:26 Akane: Yay! Yay! Yay!

01:27 Miku: Well, surprisingly, this year we Band-Maid are entering our eighth year from our formation.

01:34 Saiki: Time flies!

01:35 Misa: Time flies.

01:36 Miku: I’ve just noticed. I’m surprised, po. Time flies, po. The theme of the first episode is: our first impressions of each other!

01:47 Akane: Yay!

01:48 All: (applause)

01:50 Miku: We’ve had a lot of occasions to talk about how we were formed and in which order we joined, po. But I think we haven’t talked so much about our impressions in detail, po. So, this time, we’ll talk about what each of us thought when we met each other for the first time, po.

02:16 Kanami: Wow, I’m curious!

02:18 Miku: Probably I first met you three at the same time, po, right?

02:25 Kanami: Yes, me… Kanami and Akane and Kobato.

02:30 Miku: We met at the same time, po.

02:32 Kanami: Where did we meet?

02:33 Akane: Didn’t she say “Kanami and me” just now? Misa and Kanami and Akane met Miku.

02:40 Misa: I’m surprised.

02:42 Miku: You three were originally…

02:44 Misa: Sob sob.

02:46 Saiki: She says “sob sob” (laughs).

02:48 Miku: Kanami-chan, you knew Akane quite long before that, right, po?

02:56 Akane: Yeah.

02:57 Kanami: Yeah. When I was a singer-songwriter, Ah-chan played the drums for me, so when I was proposed this idea of starting a band named Band-Maid, I called her immediately.

03:14 Akane: Yeah.

03:15 Miku: Kanami-chan, what did you think when you met Ah-chan for the first time, po? When you were a singer-songwriter.

03:23 Akane: What?! I’m scared!

03:24 Kanami: Oh, I understand, I can talk about that.

03:27 Miku: Yes, right, po.

03:29 Kanami: Well, when I went to a concert at a venue in Yokohama as a supporting guitarist, I was introduced Ah-chan, and to tell you the truth, …

03:43 Akane: What?

03:44 Misa: What’s that?

03:46 Kanami: I thought she was cute!

03:48 Others: Wow!

03:49 Misa: I thought “to tell you the truth” meant something very different.

03:51 Akane: She doesn’t think so now.

03:54 Saiki: It’s like she’s not cute now.

03:56 Akane: She means I’m not cute now.

03:58 Miku: Isn’t she cute?

03:59 Kanami: No, Ah-chan was…

04:00 Misa: She’s become a gorilla.

04:00 Kanami: In the beginning, she was like a fake cutie [note: nekokaburi in Japanese], and she was very…

04:05 Miku: Fake cutie?!

04:09 Misa: Fake cutie.

04:11 Akane: Special move: Fake cutie!

04:12 Kanami: Special move (laughs).

04:15 Kanami: She was very cute, and I was glad to get acquaintance… not acquaintance… acquainted with such a cute good girl. That was my first impression of her.

04:28 Akane: Your first impression of a fake cutie.

04:29 Miku: Ah-chan, what did you think about Kanami?

04:32 Akane: Well, but, me too, I thought she was extremely cute. I think so now too, by the way.

04:39 Miku: This is not fun, po! This is just mutual compliments, po (laughs).

04:42 Akane: But, well, I thought “she has big eyes!”

04:45 Miku: Ah, I thought so too, po.

04:48 Akane: I thought “she has big eyes like a doll.”

04:52 Miku: I thought she had really big rolling eyes. I remember I thought I rarely saw a girl with these big eyes, po.

04:58 Akane: I also thought she had a high-pitched voice.

05:02 Others: (laughs)

05:04 Miku: Right, her voice is high, po.

05:07 Akane: Yes, [I thought so] because mine is low.

05:09 Miku: Her voice seems lower than before, po.

05:14 Kanami: Right, since we are in the eighth year, my voice has gradually become lower perhaps.

05:21 Miku: Is it supposed to become gradually lower, po? (laughs)

05:23 Akane: Maybe you have grown up.

05:25 Kanami: Perhaps.

05:27 Miku: Ah-chan and Misa, you went to the same school, po, right?

05:30 Akane: Yes, a music school [note: Tokyo School of Music Shibuya].

05:33 Miku: What did you think about Misa when you met her for the first time, po?

05:40 Akane: My impression of Misa… She was very unique, the type I hadn’t met before.

05:51 Misa: Really?

05:52 Akane: She was different from others, kind of. Her look too. Your hair was curly then, right?

05:58 Misa: I had my hair permed, and I had long bangs.

06:00 Akane: Right.

06:03 Kanami: The exact opposite of now.

06:05 Akane: Yes, the exact opposite (laughs).

06:06 Others: (laughs)

06:09 Miku: She was probably so in the beginning, po.

06:13 Misa: When I joined Band-Maid, I had my hair permed.

06:18 Miku: You swept your bangs to the side.

06:22 Misa: I swept them.

06:23 Miku: When did you get straight across bangs?

06:29 Misa: When was that? I had long bangs in the MV of Thrill. Probably after that.

06:34 Miku: So, later than I thought, two or three years after starting Band-Maid, you got straight across bangs.

06:42 Misa: Yeah.

06:43 Miku: Was that so, po? I see.

06:47 Miku: And finally we met Sai-chan together, po.

06:52 Akane: Yeah.

06:55 Saiki: Misa-chan, did you talk about your first impression of Ah-chan?

06:58 Miku: Not yet.

07:00 Akane: Tell us.

07:00 Misa: I was waiting for this chance. Is it OK to talk now?

07:03 Miku: You were waiting for it (laughs).

07:03 Akane: Come on!

07:07 Akane: Come on!

07:09 Saiki: What’s that, your “come on!” (laughs)

07:11 Others: (laughs)

07:12 Miku: What did you think, po?

07:13 Misa: Well, I thought Akane had a high-pitched voice, …

07:18 Akane: I was Kanami (laughs).

07:20 Kanami: A fake cutie, perhaps? Your special move?

07:22 Misa: I thought “she must have a low-pitched voice actually.”

07:25 Others: (laughs)

07:26 Misa: I thought “this is not her real character.”

07:29 Akane: That’s a fake cutie! (laughs)

07:32 Miku: So everyone thought you were a fake cutie, po.

07:35 Akane: I’m often said so.

07:38 Saiki: So that’s often the case with you.

07:40 Misa: I was like, “no, this is not real.”

07:42 Akane: Misa, you said so for long, right?

07:44 Miku: Actually I remeber, when I greeted Ah-chan for the first time, I thought she was very smart.

07:53 Saiki: The exact opposite.

07:54 Saiki: Why so? She’s this dumb.

07:56 Akane: Hey!

07:57 Miku: She was so polite then, like “I’m very glad to meet you”, so I thought she was a well-raised lady, po.

08:07 Akane: Because I was a fake cutie.

08:08 Saiki: But she was once a bad girl [note: yankī in Japanese].

08:10 Akane: Hey, you should stop it.

08:12 Saiki: She was once a bad girl.

08:14 Akane: Hey, stop it!! Don’t give it away!!

08:15 Miku: The second time I met her, she already showed her true self.

08:20 Akane: The first impression of me is always good.

08:25 Miku: The second time I met her, I thought “she’s a bad lady more than I expected.”

08:31 Others: A bad lady (laughs).

08:37 Kanami: On the day when we met for the first time, we four went drinking together, didn’t we?

08:42 Akane: Yes. We went to an izakaya.

08:43 Misa: We ate some hot pot.

08:45 Akane: We went to a Kinnokura [note: a low-price izakaya chain].

08:48 Misa: Was that at a Kinnokura?

08:49 Akane: Yeah.

08:51 Miku: Ah, the first day.

08:54 Saiki: I don’t care where you went.

08:55 Akane: Uh-huh, a separate room in an izakaya on the first day.

08:57 Saiki: When you all met Kobato for the first time, what was your impression?

09:02 Misa: She wore a pink jacket.

09:04 Others: (laughs)

09:07 Saiki: Why do you remember only that?

09:08 Akane: Honestly, I thought “I’ve seen such a cute girl for the first time!”

09:13 Miku: Po!

09:14 Akane: I told so to other members. I remember I said “I’ve seen such a cute girl for the first time” to Kanami.

09:20 Kanami: You said so.

09:21 Akane: I said so.

09:21 Miku: Wow!

09:22 Saiki: That’s so you. So you.

09:23 Misa: She was so cute.

09:25 Miku: Sai-chan, your way of saying is offensive, po (laughs).

09:28 Saiki: That’s so you.

09:29 Kanami: But Misa said “she was so cute” in the past tense just now.

09:33 Akane: The past tense (laughs).

09:38 Akane: She was cute.

09:40 Kanami: This is fun (laughs).

09:41 Saiki: Kobato, what was your impression of the other three?

09:46 Miku: I was scared, po, because I thought you three were already good friends with each other.

09:53 Akane: We are good friends.

09:55 Saiki: Is that because you’re lonely? That must be because you’re lonely.

09:58 Miku: I thought “if they get to hate me here, I might not be able to keep doing this, po.”

10:05 Saiki: An omen of loneliness.

10:10 Miku: I was desperate not to be hated, po.

10:13 Miku: Sai-chan, how was that when you met the rest of us for the first time? You joined last, po.

10:20 Saiki: Right. The time when I met you all?

10:26 Miku: Yeah. Your first thought, po. You must have your first impression for each, though.

10:29 Kanami: That was when we were recording Forward or something.

10:33 Saiki: That’s right. Kanami-chan was recording the guitar, and seriously, her eyes look dead.

10:39 Others: (laughs)

10:41 Saiki: I was like, “Who is this?”

10:49 Saiki: She was almost dead. I was like, “What? What’s happening here?”

10:55 Kanami: For your information, I don’t have a memory of that moment.

10:58 Saiki: She didn’t have any energy.

11:01 Akane: Because the recording was hard. It was our first recording.

11:05 Miku: We were nervous in our first recording.

11:07 Kanami: Because it was our first recording.

11:08 Saiki: It looks like it was the final day.

11:13 Saiki: You recorded the day before until late at night, and began to record again from early in the morning, and I met you in the evening.

11:23 Misa: I remember that.

11:24 Saiki: She was almost dead.

11:26 Others: (laughs)

11:28 Miku: When you’re tired your eyes look dead. You haven’t changed, po.

11:32 Kanami: I haven’t changed.

11:33 Saiki: You haven’t changed.

11:36 Miku: Even now, if you’re overwhelmed by work, you get tired and your eyes look dead.

11:41 Kanami: Everyone says, “Your eyes look dead! Look at Sai-chan!”

11:44 Miku: If you see Sai-chan, your eyes shine.

11:48 Saiki: What mechanism is that?

11:51 Kanami: Like “Look at Sai-chan! Sai-chan is coming here!” and my eyes revive.

11:59 Akane: Kanami, as well as me and Misa, we didn’t have a car for gear and we brought all of our gear with us. To recording too. We brought so heavy gear. So we were tired.

12:15 Kanami: You’re right.

12:17 Akane: We were like, “we have to bring our gear” and it was hard to just go to the station then.

12:22 Saiki: We couldn’t even ride a train.

12:24 Akane: Right, right.

12:26 Kanami: That was surely so.

12:27 Saiki: Because it was so crowded.

12:28 Akane: So you were always tired.

12:31 Miku: Maybe that’s why, po. In the beginning, we used to bring our gear to servings by train by ourselves, so Ah-chan, you knew extremely well where elevators are in each train station, po.

12:47 Akane: Yes, I know all the elevators in the Shibuya station precisely. [Note: Shibuya was their home ground when they were on the indie label.]

12:51 Akane: Now I’m not sure because it has changed a lot (laughs).

12:56 Akane: I studied them a lot.

12:57 Miku: Sure.

12:58 Miku: Mincho, how about you? What was your impression when you first met Sai-chan?

13:03 Saiki: You can start from the moment you remember.

13:05 Kanami: Ah, the moment I remember.

13:07 Miku: Because you might not remember, po.

13:09 Kanami: Speaking of the moment I remember, to tell you the truth, Ah-chan met Sai-chan first, I mean she met Sai-chan before I met Sai-chan, and she said to me “Kanami, she is probably the type you hate.”

13:25 Others: (laughs)

13:26 Akane: I remember that (laughs).

13:28 Miku: What was that, po? Did you say that, po?

13:31 Akane: Yes, yes.

13:32 Kanami: So I was scared when I met her, and I was like, “Ah, there she is.”

13:37 Others: (laughs)

13:38 Kanami: But when I actually talked with her, she was OK, so I was like, “Which is right? Which?”

13:45 Others: (laughs)

13:49 Miku: Initially Ah-chan told me so too…

13:52 Saiki: Ah-chan, you said something completely unnecessary.

13:56 Miku: Like, “She may be a difficult type.”

14:00 Others: (laughs)

14:02 Miku: I was also scared when I met you for the first time, po.

14:06 Saiki: I don’t deny that. I was a very difficult type.

14:10 Akane: Only at that time. Only then.

14:13 Miku: I don’t blame you, po, because we tricked you to join in, po.

14:17 Saiki: I was perplexed, and I didn’t trust you all, kind of.

14:24 Miku: Right, po.

14:25 Saiki: Like, “Who the hell are these women? What the hell is this?”

14:29 Miku: When I met you, …

14:29 Saiki: A sense of distrust.

14:31 Kanami: A sense of distrust (laughs).

14:31 Miku: You stared me with a very strange face, I remember, po.

14:35 Saiki: (laughs)

14:38 Miku: And your appearance was, probably, somewhat like a party girl, and you wore a miniskirt or something?

14:45 Akane: You wore a mini all the time.

14:47 Saiki: At that time, I always absolutely showed my legs.

14:50 Akane: Right. I remember.

14:52 Miku: You showed all your legs and you exposed a lot of skin, po.

14:55 Saiki: Because I was young!

14:57 Others: (laughs)

15:00 Saiki: I was young.

15:02 Miku: I thought you were a party girl, and when I said to you “Nice to meet you, po”, you were like “Huh?”

15:12 Miku: So I was scared and I was like, “What should I do? Ah-chan, help me, po!”

15:14 Akane: Sai-chan, when we talked to you, you didn’t talk back, right? You only nodded, right? You were shy. If I think back now, you were shy. But whatever I said to you, you said nothing.

15:24 Saiki: It’s true I was shy, and I was also examining you all.

15:30 Akane: I see.

15:32 Saiki: Like, “Who should I trust?”

15:35 Miku: Right, and your costume was ready.

15:39 Saiki: Like, “Who is in league with who to say this?”

15:43 Others: (laughs)

15:47 Miku: All of us members other than you knew that, po. Like, “We made Sai-chan join in without explaining anything to her.”

15:59 Misa: In my case… Sai-chan, I talked to you quite a lot, right?

16:04 Saiki: You talked to me thankfully.

16:06 Kanami: Cute! (laughs)

16:07 Misa: Sai-chan, I received your sense of distrust against us well.

16:10 Others: (laughs)

16:13 Miku: Everyone noticed it.

16:14 Saiki: All of you said “You’re all right!”

16:15 Misa: We’re like, “She’s nervous!”

16:17 Saiki: “All right! All right!”

16:20 Misa: That’s when you came to the studio for the first time.

16:23 Saiki: Ah, right, right.

16:24 Misa: And when we went out, you and me went out for the first time, so I asked you a lot of questions…

16:37 Misa: Like “Where do you live?”

16:39 Miku: She was awkward in the beginning, such as in a rehearsal, when all of us were together, po.

16:46 Akane: Kind of.

16:47 Miku: She was talking while confirming an appropriate distance, I remember that, po.

16:54 Saiki: Probably so.

16:57 Kanami: Since when are we good friends?

17:00 Miku: Since when, po?

17:01 Misa: I wonder.

17:04 Miku: We met for the first time and we did the first serving right away, po.

17:09 Akane: Yeah.

17:10 Kanami: Sure (laughs).

17:12 Miku: Since when, po? We didn’t have a bad relationship even in the beginning, po, but Sai-chan, you had a sense of distrust, po.

17:22 Others: (laughs)

17:26 Misa: Since when?

17:28 Miku: In the beginning, we often went to eat together, po. Every time.

17:34 Akane: Yes, we did.

17:35 Kanami: Uh-huh.

17:36 Misa: Rather I don’t remember that.

17:37 Akane: Really?

17:38 Misa: Did we?

17:39 Miku: Yes, we did, po. Yes, po.

17:40 Misa: I don’t remember.

17:42 Saiki: Isn’t that I didn’t go?

17:44 Others: (laughs)

17:45 Saiki: Was I there? Isn’t that I didn’t go?

17:49 Misa: If so, Sai-chan, isn’t that I went to eat with you?

17:52 Saiki: I remember I went with you, Misa-chan.

17:54 Miku: Uh-huh.

17:56 Misa: I remember.

17:58 Miku: Was that so, po?

18:00 Misa: We split up (laughs).

18:01 Others: (laughs)

18:02 Miku: What I remember then is that me, Sai-chan, and Ah-chan were the members staying up late, po, and we three kept chatting all the way in the chatting room of the five of us on LINE, so we made a chatting room for us three, po.

18:24 Misa: Yes, you did.

18:25 Kanami: You did.

18:26 Akane: That brings back memories!

18:26 Miku: And I remember the title of the chat room was too much, po.

18:33 Akane: I remember it.

18:34 Miku: Sai-chan, do you remember it, po?

18:36 Saiki: It was “self-hatred”, right?

18:37 Miku: Ah, right, po.

18:38 Others: (laughs)

18:40 Miku: The Society of Self-Hatred.

18:41 Akane: The title was insane, right? The Society of Self-Hatred. It’s insane, right?

18:46 Saiki: Insane.

18:47 Akane: What were we worried about? What were we talking about?

18:48 Miku: Yes, really, po. Too much darkness was there, po (laughs).

18:52 Saiki: No, that, well, that’s because we couldn’t read 自己嫌悪 jiko ken’o [“self-hatred”]. [Note: The second constituent of the Japanese term is difficult to read, a little similar to the English word self-abhorrence.]

18:57 Miku: Ah, couldn’t you read it, po?

18:58 Saiki: Me and Ah-chan were like, “What was this again?” and, Kobato, you taught it to us, and we were like, “Speaking of self-hatred, don’t we all kind of have it?”

19:11 Akane: Uh-huh, yes.

19:12 Saiki: We were like, “Let’s go ahead with confidence!”

19:14 Others: (laughs)

19:15 Misa: You did it positively (laughs).

19:16 Miku: I remember we sent only silly things on LINE late at night, such as funny faces…

19:24 Akane: Yeah.

19:25 Miku: And images.

19:26 Akane: We used to send them.

19:28 Miku: In the beginning, Ah-chan, you couldn’t read kanji [note: Chinese characters used in Japanese], before talking about multiplication.

19:36 Akane: No, that’s wrong. [Note: she suddenly speaks her native Kansai dialect here. She is from Kobe but almost always speaks Standard Japanese.] I can read kanji.

19:39 Others: (laughs)

19:41 Miku: I remembered now, po. Well, 一輪の花 ichirin no hana [“one stalk of flower”] or something… What was that? Sai-chan, you asked like, “What’s the meaning of this?”

19:52 Saiki: That was… 紅一点 kōitten [“a single woman among many men”, literally “one red flower in a green bush”].

19:54 Miku: Yes, kōitten!

19:55 Akane: Ah, kōitten!

19:56 Others: (laughs)

19:57 Akane: Ichirin no hana (laughs).

19:59 Saiki: Ichirin no hana!

20:00 Misa: That’s totally different.

20:01 Miku: It’s just a flower, po (laughs).

20:02 Others: (laughs)

20:04 Saiki: That was kōitten, right?

20:05 Akane: Yes, kōitten.

20:06 Miku: Sai-chan, you were the one who didn’t know it, po, right?

20:08 Saiki: That was me. You looked like “What the hell is she saying?”

20:12 Miku: We talked about something and it popped out, po, right?

20:14 Saiki: Yes. And you taught it to me, probably.

20:19 Akane: As for kanji, I’m good at them. I took a Kanken test too, and something Misa let me do…

20:24 Saiki: Ah-chan, you can only read them!

20:26 Akane: (laughs)

20:27 Misa: Isn’t that you couldn’t read 自己嫌悪 jiko ken’o?

20:29 Akane: I couldn’t get the meaning.

20:31 Miku: What was that? When we were talking about our favorite yojijukugo [note: four-kanji compounds generally from Classical Chinese, somewhat similar to Latin phrases in English], Ah-chan, I strongly remember you said 焼肉定食 yakiniku teishoku [“barbecue lunch set”] or something, po.

20:41 Others: (laughs)

20:42 Akane: I said that (laughs).

20:43 Saiki: What? Isn’t that insane?

20:44 Misa: Insane.

20:45 Akane: I said that!

20:46 Miku: I was like, “There’s no such yojijukugo, po!”

20:48 Misa: That’s a product.

20:49 Others: (laughs)

20:50 Akane: I said that.

20:52 Miku: From around that time, I think “this girl is insane, po”, I remember, po.

20:58 Akane: That brings back memories.

21:00 Miku: Even though I thought you were smart in the beginning, po.

21:02 Misa: You’ve been going down and down.

21:04 Others: (laughs)

21:06 Miku: Kanami-chan, do you have anything, po?

21:08 Kanami: Anything?

21:09 Miku: Like, the rest of us members are so different from what you thought before.

21:14 Misa: How about me?

21:16 Saiki: She wants your answer.

21:20 Kanami: Well… um… what was my first impression?…

21:26 Saiki: Kanami-chan, haven’t you lost your memories tremendously?

21:28 Others: (laughs)

21:30 Kanami: This is insane… My memories…

21:32 Miku: Are you all right, po?

21:34 Kanami: I don’t have memories…

21:36 Miku: You haven’t changed with another person, right, po?

21:38 Others: (laughs)

21:40 Saiki: Are you really Kanami-chan?

21:45 Kanami: Which self of mine at which time?…

21:48 Miku: Which self of yours, po? What do you mean, po?

21:50 Others: (laughs)

21:51 Miku: Ah, Kanami-chan, you’re not working now, po. Useless, po.

21:55 Misa: Kanami, you wore short trousers too, right?

21:57 Akane: Yes, she did (laughs).

21:59 Others: (laughs)

22:00 Miku: Yes, po! She wore short pants, po.

22:02 Saiki: She showed her legs.

22:04 Kanami: I remembered now.

22:05 Miku: Po!

22:06 Kanami: The first time me, Misa, and Ah-chan went to the studio together, that was the day when Misa was… Misa and Ah-chan were going to check whether or not to join Band-Maid.

22:25 Miku: Uh-huh.

22:26 Kanami: Then Misa came, and she got a hangover and smelled of alcohol a little.

22:31 Others: (laughs)

22:34 Misa: Was that so?

22:35 Kanami: I wondered if she was all right (laughs), and when we actually played together, I thought “This girl is not bad.” (laughs) [Note: here she jokingly imitates samurai’s way of speaking, just like when a samurai notices his opponent is as good as him.]

22:42 Others: (laughs)

22:44 Saiki: “This girl is not bad.” (laughs)

22:47 Misa: Yes, I drank until the morning, so I didn’t sleep so much.

22:50 Miku: You know, …

22:51 Akane: Right, right.

22:51 Miku: When you were invited to this, you said “Let me sleep on it while drinking all night long” so you drank a lot, po. If I remember correctly, you said so, po, in the beginning.

23:03 Saiki: The day before you were invited? I mean, were you invited the day before?

23:07 Miku: That’s right, po.

23:08 Akane: That’s true but it’s not about the day we went to the studio. But she also drank the day before we went to the studio.

23:16 Others: (laughs)

23:18 Miku: Long story short, she drank all the time.

23:21 Akane: She drank all the time.

23:22 Kanami: So much.

23:23 Miku: Mincho, in the beginning you were very worried about Misa, po, like “Misa-chan plays while drinking in the concert. Is she all right?”

23:32 Akane: Because Kanami is earnest.

23:35 Miku: I remember that clearly, po.

23:37 Kanami: I was worried she might be dizzy, and I was like “Is she all right?” probably.

23:41 Akane: We Akane-Kanami duo can’t drink… we’re not good with alcohol, so we get worried about others naturally. Drinkers might be all right, but we get drunk easily, that’s why.

23:56 Miku: Kanami-chan, you began to drink after joining Band-Maid because other members drink, po, right?

24:06 Kanami: Yes, I’m taught drinking by other members.

24:09 Others: (laughs)

24:11 Miku: If you hear only that, we look like bad guys, po.

24:14 Others: (laughs)

24:15 Kanami: I was recommended like, “This liquor tastes good, so give it a try!” and I drank and I grew up.

24:24 Miku: No, that’s not the reason. Kanami-chan, in the beginning, we wanted you to drink because you are funny when you get drunk, po.

24:28 Saiki: She’s funny (laughs).

24:29 Kanami: What? Sai-chan, why do you laugh?

24:33 Miku: You’re funny because you totally change, po.

24:35 Saiki: Right.

24:37 Kanami: How about talking about it next time? (laughs)

24:40 Others: (laughs)

24:42 Kanami: End of story.

24:43 Misa: She dodged it well.

24:44 Miku: My attack was dodged, po.

24:49 Miku: So, we’ve gradually strengthened our ties like that, and we’re entering our eighth year, po.

24:58 Miku: From now, there might be someone among us members who will change again.

25:02 Others: (laughs)

25:04 Saiki: From now?

25:06 Saiki: Someone will change again from now?

25:07 Akane: That’s insane (laughs).

25:08 Kanami: In what way? Do you mean someone’s personality will change?

25:12 Miku: Yes, just like your personality changed from what you were initially, …

25:17 Akane: (laughs)

25:20 Misa: Will she change once again?

25:21 Miku: She might change once again, po. A new Kanami-chan might come out, po.

25:26 Misa: She will evolve like Pokémon.

25:28 Akane: Evolution.

25:29 Others: (laughs)

25:30 Miku: An evolved Kanami-chan…

25:31 Saiki: That’s because we did Evolution!

25:32 Akane: I see.

25:34 Misa: If so, this year, maybe?

25:36 Saiki: Because of Evolution. I see.

25:38 Miku: A new Kanami-chan might appear again this year, po.

25:42 Kanami: Only me? (laughs)

25:43 Akane: You said “Only me” (laughs)

25:47 Miku: I don’t know. You know, Sai-chan might suddenly make a kakuhen [note: a jackpot-ready state in pachinko] or something, and…

25:52 Saiki: Kakuhen?

25:54 Akane: Kakuhen?! Insane! Hey, you!! Kakuhen?!

25:56 Saiki: Hey, you’re gambling too much!!

25:58 Akane: That’s gambling!

26:00 All: (laughs)

26:04 Miku: I must be careful, po. I must be careful, po.

26:07 Miku: You might evolve a lot, um, suddenly to become able to communicate with others very well, like partygoers.

26:15 Saiki: Impossible.

26:20 Miku: I don’t want you to be like partygoers, po.

26:23 Saiki: That’s impossible without drinking.

26:25 Others: (laughs)

26:27 Miku: Actually Misa-chan said she’s nervous even in this recording and she drinks.

26:31 Others: (laughs)

26:33 Saiki: She drinks too much.

26:37 Miku: Now, it’s about time…

26:39 Saiki: Yes.

26:41 Miku: Since we’re doing radio, we want listeners to listen to a song too, po.

26:46 Saiki: A song? OK.

26:48 Miku: I was thinking who I should ask to choose a song for our first episode, po. As I said before, we’re recording this remotely, and there was someone who came very late, po.

27:04 Miku: Like, “What? Isn’t she there, po?”

27:05 Saiki: Who’s that?

27:07 Miku: Who was that, po?

27:08 Akane: Who?

27:09 Misa: You.

27:10 Akane: Agane! That’s Akane!

27:14 Others: Agane! (laughs)

27:16 Miku: That’s you. Now, Akane-san.

27:21 Akane: Yes.

27:22 Miku: Akane-san, I’d like you to choose the song of the first episode, po.

27:27 Akane: Yes.

27:30 Saiki: What do you choose?

27:32 Akane: What to choose?… How about making it a quiz? I want you to answer. Is it a hassle?

27:37 Misa: OK.

27:38 Miku: The quiz covers too many songs, po, right? A hint? We want a hint, po.

27:44 Akane: I’ll choose it from Conqueror.

27:47 Miku: Po! From the album Conqueror.

27:49 Akane: Yeah. It’s from Conqueror, and my impression of this song is, “it’s beautiful.”

28:02 Miku: “It’s beautiful”?

28:03 Saiki: “It’s beautiful”?

28:04 Akane: Yes, it’s beautiful, and I think its composition is, what should I say, very dramatic and story-based.

28:12 Miku: Po.

28:13 Misa: Uh-huh.

28:13 Akane: And when I play it, it has a lot of development, and it changes again and again and again.

28:21 Saiki: I know! I know! I know! I know!

28:26 Akane: Saiki-san!

28:27 Miku: Sai-chan.

28:28 Saiki: Wonderland.

28:29 Akane: Ding ding ding!

28:31 Saiki: Yay!

28:33 Miku: Sure, its development changes the most.

28:35 Saiki: It’s beautiful.

28:36 Akane: I’m always touched by Wonderland!

28:40 Kanami: (laughs)

28:41 Akane: Kanami, that’s so you. Kanami-sensei. [Note: here Akane jokingly but also respectfully calls Kanami with sensei, a title for a master of art.]

28:44 Saiki: She’s embarrassed. Kanami-sensei is embarrassed.

28:47 Akane: So, I’ve chosen Wonderland because I like it so much.

28:51 Miku: Kanami-sensei, do you have anything to say about Wonderland, po?

28:56 Kanami: I wrote Wonderland imagining Sai-chan singing the intro with her very beautiful voice.

29:08 Others: (laughs)

29:11 Saiki: I’ll do my best.

29:13 Kanami: I’m useless now. I don’t talk with anyone recently, so now I can’t talk well.

29:17 Others: (laughs)

29:19 Miku: Oh no, po.

29:20 Saiki: Good luck!

29:22 Kanami: It’s difficult… to start it with my guitar with Sai-chan at the same time… at concerts.

29:30 Others: (laughs)

29:32 Miku: Please work hard at it, po. Sensei, please work hard at it, po.

29:39 Kanami: I’ll work hard at it.

29:41 Saiki: Let’s work hard at it.

29:42 Kanami: Yeah.

29:43 Saiki: But you’re better now than on the final day of Evolution.

29:54 Kanami: Thanks.

29:57 Saiki: Because we practiced in the studio.

30:01 Kanami: Yeah.

30:02 Saiki: When we could still go into the studio.

30:06 Kanami: Yeah.

30:07 Saiki: You improved quite a lot then.

30:10 Kanami: Thank you very much.

30:12 Kanami: I appreciate your gracious words. [Note: here she jokingly speaks in a grandiose manner, as if she spoke to the queen.]

30:15 Others: (laughs)

30:18 Miku: I’m getting confused about what we’re talking about, po. Now, Ah-chan, …

30:24 Saiki: Your introduction of the song.

30:25 Miku: Please introduce the song, po.

30:27 Akane: Yes, please listen to Wonderland.

(Wonderland)

31:54 Miku: Well, this time let’s say good-bye now, po.

31:59 Others: Yes.

32:01 Miku: How was that, po?

32:03 Others: That was fun!

32:08 Miku: It’s good if that was fun, po. If you have a theme you want to ask or you want to know, please tell us, po.

32:14 Saiki: Please tell us.

32:18 Misa: Materials. Give us materials.

32:20 Others: (laughs)

32:22 Miku: Misa-chan, are you tipsy, po?

32:25 Misa: I’m feeling tipsy.

32:27 Others: (laughs)

32:30 Miku: That’s all from Band-Maid, Miku Kobato, …

32:32 Saiki: And Saiki, …

32:34 Kanami: And Kanami, …

32:35 Akane: And Akane, …

32:37 Misa: And Misa.

32:38 Miku: Po! Bye-bye kuruppo!

32:41 Kanami: Good-bye!

32:43 Others: Bye-bye!
