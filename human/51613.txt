How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

Here is my behind-the-scenes story of Unseen World. By the time the album production was completed, surprisingly, I, Mincho, lost as much as 5 kilos [11 pounds].

I’ve already recovered though, so there’s nothing to worry about, but releasing an album might feel similar to giving birth to a baby.

So, everyone, I’ll be glad if you kindly listen to, love, and raise my cute songs I gave birth to with my best effort.
