How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

February was Sai-chan’s birth month, wasn’t it?

Thank you for being born!

Thank you for doing the band with me.

Saiki-sensei also writes lyrics these days, doesn’t she?

Everyone, this month, let’s listen together to the song Saiki-sensei wrote lyrics to.

So, my “Song of the Month” is Corallium.
