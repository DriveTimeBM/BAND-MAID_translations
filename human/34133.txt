00:01 Kobato: Mincho, I want you to sing it, po.

00:08 Kanami: Do I have to sing alone?

00:09 Kobato: No, you can sing it with everyone, po.

00:10 Kanami: OK, let’s sing together.

00:12 Kanami: Well then…

00:14 Kanami: Everyone, are you ready?!

00:18 Kanami: We go to battle now!

00:20 Kobato: Battle?! Do you go to battle, po? (laughs)

00:22 Kanami: Well, we will sing a song called “Happy Birthday” together.

00:29 Kanami: Here we go!

00:30 Kanami: Ready, go!

00:31 Kanami: [Singing] Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday dear Koba…

00:48 Kanami: Ready, go!

00:49 Kanami: [Singing] Happy birthday to you.

00:55 Kobato: Po! Thank you, po!

00:58 Kanami: Kobato!

00:59 Kobato: Thanks, po!

01:02 Kanami: How old will you turn?

01:04 Kobato: Um, I, Kobato, will turn 810 years old, well, one, two, three, four, five… the sixth time, po.

01:13 Kanami: The sixth time?

01:14 Kobato: Yeah, this is my sixth time to turn 810 years old, po.

01:17 Kobato: Those of you new to this probably can’t get it, but, “You’re Hato, so you’re 810 years old”, Sai-chan told me so, po. [Note: “810” can be read “hato” (“pigeon”) in Japanese.]

01:26 Kobato: Since then, I’ve been repeating, repeating, and repeating 810 years old, po.

01:32 Kobato: So, this is my sixth time to turn 810 years old, po!

01:38 Kanami: They are all so kind!

01:39 Kobato: It’s nice they are all kind, po.

01:41 Kanami: There was so much, so loud voice.

01:43 Kobato: Right, I’m happy, po!

01:45 Kanami: Good for you!

01:45 Kobato: Yeah.

01:46 Kanami: Happy birthday.

01:47 Kobato: Thank you very much, po.

01:49 Kanami: So, please have fun celebrating Kobato-san.
