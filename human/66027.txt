I’m Akane.

December is my birth month!

This year too, you all celebrated my birthday, so I spent it happily.

Masters and princesses, thank you so much for warm messages and images. I’m happy.

For my “Song of the Month”, I’ve chosen About Us with gratitude.

Everyone, thank you always. Thank you for your continued support.

This is the image of the cake when my bandmates celebrated my birthday! Thanks!
