00:00 Hi, I’m Misa.

00:01 How have you been?

00:03 I’m fine.

00:06 So, this time I’d like to introduce you a bass in my house, I mean this time I’d like to introduce you this fretless bass.

00:15 Can you see this?

00:18 Well, the fretless bass has no frets.

00:24 An ordinary bass has these lines called frets, it has these frets, but this fretless bass has no frets at all.

00:38 I got this fretless bass probably already 9 years ago, when I was in another band before I started Band-Maid, which was a grunge band, and I chose this regardless of that.

00:53 I originally used to use a Fender bass and the like, but out of curiosity, I wanted to play this bass by picking, so I got it.

01:05 It brings back memories.

01:08 The maker of this bass is Warwick.

01:12 Warwick’s RockBass. It’s called a RockBass even though it’s fretless. Well, I was probably attracted also to its name at that time.

01:23 Well, an ordinary bass with frets sounds clear, but this fretless bass, with no frets, sounds a little fluffy.

01:34 Now, I play this bass to show you how it sounds.

01:38 Let’s start with a slide.

01:50 Like this actually, as it has no frets, the slide really sounds like it keeps going forever.

02:00 It’s interesting, right?

02:09 Actually, as it has no frets, I sometimes lose track of where I’m playing.

02:16 It’s difficult because a slight position change alters the pitch.

02:52 I came up with a little interesting phrase just now.

03:02 Then, I’ll use a pick now.

03:09 See? The pitch is a little difficult.

03:14 If the position is slightly shifted…

03:18 It makes such unpleasant sounds, so I have to practice a little more. It’s difficult, right?

03:27 Lastly, I’ll play it randomly.

03:52 OK. Well then, everyone, if you have a chance, please try a fretless bass!

04:00 See you later. That’s all from Misa.
