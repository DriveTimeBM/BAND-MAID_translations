Hi, I’m Misa.

Well, here’s my behind-the-scenes story of May 10. In my case, as a behind-the-scenes story of May 10, “The Day of Maid”, nothing particular came to my mind, but if any, I could hardly get into the assassin mode until it started.

Um, I panicked like “I can’t become Misa”, “I want to meet my past self”, but when the first note of the opening music started and I drank a little, I found myself turned on.

I’d forgotten it, but I gradually remembered I usually started like that. Yeah.

I realized again Misa is saved by drinking. Apparently.

Well, bye-bye.
