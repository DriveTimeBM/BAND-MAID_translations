I’m Akane.

Here’s my behind-the-scenes story of “The Day of Maid”. On my way to the venue, I found a gacha of Haikyu!!, the anime I’m the most into now, but I couldn’t play it because I had no coins at that moment.

Then, when I got into the venue while feeling disappointed, I met Cluppo-san just before her rehearsal, so I greeted her and told her I couldn’t play the gacha, then she gave me 400 yen like “Go and play the gacha with this, po!”

Cluppo-san, thank you so much!

PEACE & LOVE! (laughs)

I was able to do my best at the concert after that.

Let’s do an Okyu-ji together again!
