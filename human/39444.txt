Masters and princesses! Yoo-hoo! I’m Akane. How do you spend time at home now?

I spend time at home by doing strengthening training of basics every day, in a way I can do at home using hand and foot practicing pads.

In addition, I do workout and stretching with a Switch game called Ring Fit Adventure.

It’s as effective as going to a gym, so I try my best to keep doing it every day!

I will update you again. Let’s work hard at it together! That’s all from Akane.

Bye-bye!
