I’m Misa.

My “Song of the Month” is Anemone.

It has been raining a lot lately, and one day, the sunset after the rain was so beautiful and it was such a soothing scenery.

At such a moment, I feel like a song plays in myself, which is… Anemone.

All right, well, it’s time to drink.

See you, bye-bye!
