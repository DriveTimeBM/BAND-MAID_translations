How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

My favorite way to spend at-home time is definitely to grind coffee beans myself, make a pour-over coffee and drink it.

I drink decaf from my second cup in order not to take too much caffeine.

If, um, if you haven’t made a pour-over coffee yourself, I think it would be nice to give it a try.

You can find how to make it on YouTube and the like, so please give it a try by any means.
