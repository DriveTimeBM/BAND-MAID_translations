00:00 Misa: Hi, I’m Misa.

00:02 Misa: Today I have a special guest, a gorilla who moved from a zoo in Hyogo Prefecture to a zoo in Tokyo and admires my fashion!

00:16 Misa: Please come in!

00:19 [Caption] Akane-san is invited as a guest today

00:19 Akane: Hi, I’m a gorilla who has just moved to Tokyo. [Note: Akane was born in Kobe, Hyogo and moved to Yokohama (in the Tokyo area) in her early teens, and now she lives in Tokyo.]

00:22 Misa: Ha ha ha (laughs).

00:24 Misa: Gorilla-san, thank you for coming today.

00:25 Akane: Thank you for inviting me.

00:26 Akane: I don’t know well about vintage clothes, so could you please make me a vintage clothing gorilla in the Shimokitazawa style like you?

00:40 Akane: By using your clothes, Misa-san.

00:41 Misa: Yes, so, today, I’ll make you a fantastic gorilla…

00:45 Akane: A fantastic vintage clothing gorilla (laughs).

00:50 Misa: I’ll make you so.

00:50 [Caption] Akane-san is going to wear vintage outfits today

00:52 Akane: Yes, thank you.

00:54 Both: Now…

00:55 Akane: Hoo-hoo! [Note: a gorilla’s voice.]

00:56 Misa: Olé!

00:58 Akane: This is sloppy (laughs).

00:59 Misa: First of all, let’s start with the first outfit.

01:01 Misa: This time I put it together to make you a unique gorilla.

01:07 Akane: That’s… an unusual pattern.

01:11 Misa: This, this one, is my favorite.

01:14 Akane: It’s an unusual pattern.

01:16 Misa: I match this fluffy cap to it, and this pair of black skinny pants.

01:28 Misa: You’ll look cool if you match black skinny pants to it.

01:32 Misa: How about this?

01:33 Akane: Awesome.

01:35 Akane: No one at the zoo in Hyogo wore such an outfit.

01:40 Misa: Then, would you like to wear it?

01:42 Akane: Yes.

01:43 Misa: Now, the first outfit.

01:44 Misa: We’ve made a unique gorilla!

02:07 Misa: You’re cool.

02:11 Misa: How do you feel?

02:12 Akane: I haven’t worn this kind of pattern. And this clutch bag (laughs).

02:18 Akane: With this fish clutch bag as an accent, I pursue uniqueness.

02:23 Akane: Did I pursue uniqueness? (laughs)

02:27 Misa: Unique fashion.

02:31 Akane: Is this all right? Is this correct? I can’t get it at all, so I’m perplexed.

02:35 Misa: It’s good. You look cool.

02:36 Akane: Really?

02:37 Misa: Yeah.

02:38 Akane: Actually this is not a clutch bag at all.

02:41 Misa: This is a fish pillow my mom gave to me as a present when I was in junior high school.

02:48 Akane: Wow, you’re great as usual.

02:50 Misa: I take good care of things.

02:51 Akane: Misa-san, you’re great.

02:53 Akane: You’re great because you have this in your house.

02:56 Misa: All right, the next is the second outfit.

03:00 Misa: I put it together with this biker jacket, imagining a fast-running gorilla.

03:06 Akane: It looks fast. It’s a speed gorilla.

03:15 Misa: And a light color.

03:17 Akane: Ah, I see.

03:21 Akane: This will increase my physical ability (laughs), yes…

03:27 Misa: A speedy gorilla?

03:28 Akane: I’ll wear it with a speedy feel.

03:31 Misa: Then, would you like to wear it?

03:32 Akane: Yes.

03:33 Misa: Now, the second outfit.

03:36 Misa: Has she become a fast-running gorilla?

03:48 Akane: You ride on the back? [Note: Akane imitates a male biker.]

03:55 Misa: You’re cool.

03:58 Misa: Can you run fast now?

03:58 Akane: Yes.

04:00 Akane: Awesome. I always lose to the boss gorilla when competing for a banana, but today I think I can get one!

04:08 Misa: Wow.

04:11 Misa: All right, lastly, the third outfit.

04:14 Misa: A long coat? Pure black leather.

04:18 Akane: Awesome, it’s so shiny.

04:21 Misa: And I want to make you an assassin gorilla with this.

04:24 Akane: Oh, it’s cool.

04:27 Akane: Wow, is that a hat?

04:28 Misa: A hat.

04:29 Misa: And this black one to it. It’s really a black outfit.

04:34 Akane: Yes. It’s awesome. It’s cool.

04:37 Misa: Look.

04:38 Akane: Wow! It’s cool!

04:40 Misa: You’ll be an assassin gorilla.

04:41 Akane: Yes.

04:42 Akane: I’ll be able to kill silently.

04:46 Akane: Awesome. Yes.

04:49 Misa: OK, let’s check the last one.

04:52 Misa: We’re looking forward to seeing how she has turned into an assassin. Here we go.

05:17 Misa: What are you throwing? (laughs)

05:22 Misa: What? (laughs)

05:23 Misa: What? What?

05:25 Akane: I’m stabbing.

05:26 Misa: Uh-huh, you’re stabbing.

05:29 Misa: You’re cool, really.

05:33 Misa: But, sorry, I won’t wear it myself.

05:37 Misa: OK. How do you feel after trying the three outfits?

05:40 Akane: Well, I think I found my new self.

05:46 Misa: Nice to hear that (laughs).

05:48 Misa: It was fun, right?

05:49 Akane: Yeah, I can’t help having a different personality.

05:53 Misa: Yeah, your personality was different.

05:54 Akane: My personality becomes different.

05:55 Misa: Interesting.

05:56 Akane: Well, if you put together an outfit with a theme, you can change your personality, so, everyone, I think it’s good to put it together while imagining what you want to be.

06:10 Misa: Um, originally, vintage clothes… I often wear vintage clothes, so we started like you’re a gorilla admiring vintage clothes, but you’ve become an assassin like this in the end (laughs).

06:24 Akane: Vintage clothes. But these are vintage clothes, right?

06:26 Misa: Right.

06:27 Akane: Uh-huh. Clothes are fun!

06:29 Misa: That suits you, that Ray-Ban (laughs).

06:34 Akane: I don’t know, does this suit me?

06:36 Misa: It suits you.

06:37 Akane: Does it suit me?

06:38 Misa: I don’t know, sorry.

06:39 Akane: We don’t know, right?

06:40 Akane: But this is not about whether these three outfits suit me or not…

06:44 Misa: Fashion is determination.

06:45 Akane: Yeah, themes.

06:46 Misa: It’s determination.

06:47 Akane: However, if the theme is what suits me, it’ll be different, right?

06:50 Misa: Yeah, different.

06:51 Misa: I’ll choose different clothes, probably.

06:54 Misa: Well, we can do it again next time.

06:55 Akane: Yeah. Next time…

06:56 Misa: Because it’s a little fun (laughs).

06:57 Akane: Vintage clothes that suit me, next time?

07:00 Misa: Yeah, sounds nice.

07:01 Akane: Like that.

07:01 Misa: We’ll try maybe.

07:02 Akane: Yeah! We’ll try, right?

07:06 Akane: I think I can be a gorgeous female.

07:07 Misa: A female gorilla? (laughs)

07:08 Akane: Yes, I’ll do my best to become a gorgeous female gorilla.

07:12 Akane: Thank you for your continued support.

07:14 Misa: Well, that’s all for today.

07:16 Misa: See you, bye-bye!
