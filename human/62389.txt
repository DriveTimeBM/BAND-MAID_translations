Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

Kate was released on Netflix, po, right? Have you seen it yet, po?

We shot our scene around late September in 2019 in Thailand, po.

There were a lot of things we experienced for the first time, and that was so much fun, po!

After shooting in Thailand, we immediately went on a US tour, so it was hard, but I remember we had really fulfilling days, po.

I want to go overseas to do servings there again, po!

So, my “Song of the Month” is Choose me!

Bye-bye, po!
