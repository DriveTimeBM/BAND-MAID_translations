O-mei-syu-sama, hello. I’m Akane.

Today I introduce Kanami.

I’ve been friends with her for nearly 10 years, and she’s the one who kindly invited me to Band-Maid.

She told me even before forming Band-Maid that she wanted to form a band with me, so I’m very happy and grateful that I’m in the band with her like this now.

She’s a really precious friend who has been supporting me for 10 years.

The songs she writes and her guitar are both awesome!

Kanami, let’s stay together.

That’s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
