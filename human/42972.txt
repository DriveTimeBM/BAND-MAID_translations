Hello, I’m Misa.

This time I introduce Sai-chan. Well, she’s a cool and extremely beautiful woman on stage, but actually, as you all know, her smile she occasionally shows is very cute, you know.

Also her yaeba [vampire teeth] are so awesome, right?

Moreover, she becomes a cheerful tomboy when we drink outside of work.

I can’t get enough of her contrast [“gap”], you know.

Sai-chan, I love you. Tee hee hee.

See you. That’s all from Misa.
