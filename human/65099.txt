Hi, I’m Akane.

I often play games with my bandmates in my spare time, and recently I’ve been really into a puzzle game Sai-chan showed me named Machinarium!

And last time, I had a great time playing Mario Tennis with Misa.

I’m looking for games the five of us can play together, so please let me know if you have any recommendations!

Speaking of games, my “Song of the Month” is the battle theme song of the All-Japan e-Sports Competition 2021, Hibana!

Please listen to it!
