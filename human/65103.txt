Hello, I’m Misa.

My “Song of the Month” is Hide-and-seek.

The other day, I played it for the first time in a while, and that made me feel nostalgic.

I hope I can play it at concerts again someday.

Back when I wrote its bass line, I think I sent it confidently to some of my bandmates, and also to our field manager, like “I’ve written a very good bass line!”

Please someone play it. It’s fun.

This is a picture of slippers I bought recently at Nitori for around 200 yen.

I don’t have many pictures to share.

See you.
