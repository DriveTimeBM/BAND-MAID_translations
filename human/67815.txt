Hello, o-mei-syu-sama. I’m Saiki.

How are you?

Um, my “Song of the Month” is Anemone.

The reason is because I’ve been listening to it a lot lately.

Everyone, please give it a listen.

Um, this is totally unrelated, but I, Sai-chan, have been growing hyacinths recently, so please take a look at the picture.

See you.
