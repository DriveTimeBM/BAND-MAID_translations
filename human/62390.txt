How are you? I’m Kanami.

Um, September is Mincho-chan’s birthday!… birth month.

What do you think I’ll do on my birthday?

Hmm, this year… also this year, surprisingly, I’ll work at home!

You know, we can’t go out now.

I’ll order something delicious and enjoy my birthday at home!

Lastly, as for my “Song of the Month”, I interwove the vibe of my favorite genre or taste in the song.

Bubble!
