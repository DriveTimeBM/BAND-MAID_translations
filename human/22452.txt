00:02 O-mei-syu-sama, hello.

00:04 I aaam Kanamincho!

00:07 A while ago, we went around a lot of countries.

00:11 We went to Mexico, and Switzerland, and Singapore, and Malaysia.

00:17 Thankfully, masters and princesses in each country were all glad to see us, and we were so happy too.

00:23 Also, local foods tasted amazing.

00:26 So, we’ve uploaded a lot on Instagram and the like, so please check them out.

00:33 We’ve uploaded the music video of Start over recently. Have you watched it yet?

00:40 We wrote it hoping to make it a song all of you can sing along, so please memorize the melody and the lyrics, and we’d like to sing it together at servings.

00:54 Well then, that’s all from Kanamincho.

00:57 Thank you very much.
