I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

All of them are going to introduce me, so I’m nervous.

What should I do? I wonder if they say something funny about me (laughs).

But they are all so kind that they must be going to do a fantastic introduction of me.

By the way, as for me, I love all of my bandmates!

That’s all from Kanamincho.
