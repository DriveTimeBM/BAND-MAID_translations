Kobato’s “Song of the Month” in June is Matchless GUM, po.

Why is that song, you ask, because this month, June, is my beloved cat Tora’s birthday, po.

Tora is such a baby, and if I don’t play with him, he meows for life, and sometimes, maybe because he feels lonely, he meows in the middle of the night and wakes me up, po.

So, “I can’t sleep at all” like in this song, po (laughs).

He’s too cute to be mad at, po, and just like this song, “You’re all I think of”, po.

See you, po!
