How are you? I’m Kanami.

I hope the world where we can sing along together will finally come back this year, so I’ve chosen Endless Story for my “Song of the Month”.

This is a picture of a mochi that was left on New Year’s Day and I ate with butter, soy sauce, and nori.

How do you all like to eat mochi?

Well, see you!
