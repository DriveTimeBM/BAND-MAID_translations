I’m Akane.

Here’s my behind-the-scenes story of Unseen World. I gained muscles on my arms and legs from the production to the recording! (laughs)

No wonder I gained muscles.

The tempo is so fast this time too.

BLACK HOLE is the fastest ever with a tempo of 220.

From now on too, songs Kanami writes will make me ripped!

Please don’t miss it!
