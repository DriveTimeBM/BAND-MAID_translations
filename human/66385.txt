Hi, I’m Misa.

This time, I choose Corallium for my “Song of the Month”.

I’ve been listening to only this song recently, and I think its sound making is nice, if I say so myself.

Everyone, please listen to it again.

It’s been cold recently, so please be careful not to catch a cold.

A while ago, Black Cloud, who’re always helping me out, sent me long yams of Nagano. I ate a long yam hot pot with Akane and Sai-chan, and that warmed up my body and heart.

Well, see you.
