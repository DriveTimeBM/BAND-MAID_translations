I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

I’m answering today’s question.

Well, from Kuruppo MAID IN NAGOYA-san.

“I’d like to know which guitarist and which band you have been influenced by other than Santana. And where do your guitar riffs and sound ideas come from?”

Um, there are so many guitarists and bands I’ve been influenced by, I wouldn’t be able to name them within 30 seconds. As for ideas, I put importance on inputs and outputs.

I listen to various artists while analyzing them in my own way, and I keep on writing a lot of guitar riffs as outputs like a riff making machine.

I will continue to improve myself, so please support me.

Thank you for your question.
