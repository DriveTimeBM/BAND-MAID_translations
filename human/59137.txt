Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po!

It’s been hot lately, po, right?

And unexpectedly, there’s a sudden heavy rain and thunder. That really surprises me, po.

Everyone, please be careful, po. Life first, po.

At this moment too, thunder is roaring while I’m recording my voice, po.

I’ve chosen a song that would give you a strong heart against heavy rain and thunder as my “Song of the Month”, po!

Screaming!
