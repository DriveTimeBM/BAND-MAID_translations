How are you? I’m Mincho.

Um, here is my behind-the-scenes story of “The Day of Maid”. Well, the four of us on the floor, in FREEDOM, talked about a game where the first one to touch Fukkun, the sound engineer, wins, and I, Mincho, won wonderfully!

I managed to get to Fukkun, the sound engineer, so it was so much fun (laughs).

Personally, um, even though we had a lot of space on the floor to play, the four of us gathered in the end very often, so I couldn’t help laughing.
