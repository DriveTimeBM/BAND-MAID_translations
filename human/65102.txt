How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

What do you think is Mincho’s “Song of the Month”?

I’ll give you a hint. I wrote the song while thinking “music is freedom!”

Um, the answer is NO GOD!

I’m really grateful for being allowed to do what I want to do, freely and with fun, in Band-Maid.

This is a picture of a chou à la crème I made for the first time in a long time, around last month.

I love everything sweet!

Well then, see you.
