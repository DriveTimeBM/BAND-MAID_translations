Kuruppo! I’m Miku Kobato, po!

This time I’ll introduce Kanami-chan, po.

Mincho is a little weird girl even though she doesn’t know it herself, po.

She sometimes awakens in servings and surprises everyone, po.

She’s usually soft and dreamy, but in our rehearsals and dress rehearsals she controls tightly, so we can go on smoothly as scheduled thanks to her, po. Thanks, po.

Mincho likes coffee and we often go and drink coffee together, and she loves green and Coji-Coji.

She’s so lovely I love her, po!

Now, it’s about time, bye-bye, po!
