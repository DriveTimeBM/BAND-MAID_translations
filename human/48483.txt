Kuruppo! I’m answering one of your questions, po!

The question is: “Why did you give Rinne a Japanese title?” po. I thought “Reincarnation” was also cool of course, po, but I wanted to give an impact like kaboom rather visually, po.

So I named it Rinne in kanji, po.

I also named Catharsis in katakana because I thought it would convey both the look and the meaning better, po.

I’m so particular about song titles that I rethink over and over about them for nuances, and I name them while talking with Sai-chan about their looks, so I’ll be glad if you carefully check them from now on, po!

That’s all from Kobato, po. Bye-bye, po!
