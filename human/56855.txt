Kuruppo, o-mei-syu-sama!

Well, Kobato’s “Song of the Month” is Mirage, po.

We are entering the rainy season, po.

I don’t like rain, because I’m a pigeon, po, but as for me Kobato, rain reminds me of Mirage, po.

Intense songs that would blow away the rainy season may be nice, but once in a while it’s nice to drink coffee while listening to that song calmly in rain, po!

Bye-bye, po!
