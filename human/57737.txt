Hi, I’m Akane.

It’s June. It’s the rainy season.

I used to hate going out in the rainy season because it’s too damp. Recently I bought the same rain boots as Kanami’s, so even on a depressing rainy day, once I put on the same rain boots as hers, I get excited and feel sooo fine!

So, my “Song of the Month” is Catharsis, which will make you feel fine!

Let’s get through the rainy season!
