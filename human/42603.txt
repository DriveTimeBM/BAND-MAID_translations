Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po!

This is my last introduction of my bandmates, and it’s about Akane, po! [Note: Miku probably recorded five messages at once and she didn’t know her introduction of Misa would be the last.]

Ah-chan is the most sociable member among us, po.

I think she has the most number of friends, po.

She’s cheerful, and she eats natto on rice all the time, po.

She’s sometimes a little silly, po, and I get worried when she can’t recite the multiplication table well, po, but she’s always so powerful I’m amazed at her, po.

Moreover, Ah-chan’s funny face is literally funny, po!

That’s all from Kobato, po. Bye-bye, po!
