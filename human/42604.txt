I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

Today I’d like to introduce Sai-chan.

Sai-chan is very good at singing, and that’s definitely because of her efforts. She works out every day for singing and she’s very strict with herself.

She’s beautiful from head to toe, and also very good at cooking.

She speaks her mind clearly, and she’s very cool every time.

I love her.

That’s all.
