00:00 Hi, I’m Misa.

00:01 Today I’ll bring you a special feature of difficult Band-Maid bass phrases including 5 songs [note: actually 5 phrases from 4 songs].

00:08 [Caption] The B-melody of Dilemma in CONQUEROR

00:16 [Caption] What is difficult is the phrase from around 16 seconds of this video. I consciously spread fingers wide.

00:29 [Caption] Also a phrase of Dilemma in CONQUEROR

00:34 [Caption] The difficult phrase is from around 42 seconds of this video. I rather concentrate on my right hand. I play it with alternate picking. It’s fast, right?

00:49 [Caption] The bass and guitar solo battle of Turn me on in WORLD DOMINATION

00:57 [Caption] I concentrate on the tempo and I’m conscious of not being late to the first note of each part.

01:06 [Caption] The bass solo of DICE in WORLD DOMINATION

01:13 [Caption] The tempo is not very fast, but if I’m not relaxed my fingers can’t really catch up, so I’m conscious of getting relaxed and play it with calmness.

01:21 [Caption] The bass behind the guitar solo of Mirage in CONQUEROR

01:30 [Caption] The right hand finger picking is quite fast. If I don’t get relaxed consciously, I often can’t play it through.

01:46 Everyone, thank you for watching!

01:48 This is a good chance for you to try to play Band-Maid songs!

01:50 See you!
