Hello, o-mei-syu-sama. I’m Saiki.

Um, for my “Song of the Month”, since it’s June, there’s Father’s Day, so I’d like to choose Big Dad.

It’s a song where Kobato sings lead, but somehow she didn’t choose it… it seems she wasn’t in the mood for it, so I, Sai-chan, chose it for her.

Please listen to it.

Bye-bye.
