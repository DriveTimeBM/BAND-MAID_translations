Kuruppo, I’m Kobato, po.

As a behind-the-scenes story of Unseen World, I’ll talk about the lyrics, po.

I wrote the lyrics emphasizing storylines this time, po.

For example, the monologue part of Sayonakidori is actually one scene of R&J, po.

The title “sayonakidori” also means a nightingale in English, a birdie that appears in Romeo and Juliet, po.

Other than that, I’ve hidden secrets in various parts, such as a Russian magic spell in the chorus of H-G-K, po.

Please pay attention to them, po!
