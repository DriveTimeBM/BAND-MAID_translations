Hi, I’m Akane.

My “Song of the Month” is Dilemma.

We’ve had really a lot of problems, like we want to do servings with you masters and princesses but there are pretty difficult issues, and the five of us want to gather and hang out together but we can’t, but I hope we will blow away those dilemmas this year, which is why I have selected this song.

Thank you for supporting us Band-Maid in 2022.

Let’s have a fun year!

That’s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
