00:10 Miku: Welcome back home, masters and princesses, kuruppo.

00:17 Miku: Welcome back home, masters and princess! [sic] We are Band-Maid, po! [Note: said in English.]

00:23 Miku: I’m the guitarist-vocalist, kuruppo, Kobato, po.

00:28 Saiki: I’m Saiki, the vocalist.

00:30 Kanami: I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

00:32 Akane: I’m Akane, the drummer.

00:34 Misa: I’m Misa, the bassist.

00:36 Miku: Well, so, yesterday, we finally released our first exclusive video work, World Domination Tour: Shinka, po!

00:49 All: (Applause)

00:50 Akane: Yay!

00:52 Miku: Everyone, have you already watched it, po?

00:57 Miku: Yes, yes, thank you, po. Oh, not yet? I see, po.

01:03 Miku: We joined YouTube Music Week at 11 a.m. today, po. That was so much fun, po.

01:17 Miku: Everyone, how was that, po? We members watched it together and wrote comments, po, right?

01:22 Akane: Yes.

01:25 Miku: I, Kobato, probably wrote a lot of comments but few people seem to have found them, so I got sulky, po.

01:30 Others: (laughs)

01:34 Saiki: You were sulky.

01:35 Miku: I was sulky, po.

01:37 Saiki: Pigeon Breast Muscle.

01:39 Akane: Pigeon Breast Muscle.

01:41 Miku: Because someone wrote it. I was called Pigeon Breast or Ripped or Muscle, so I thought I was Pigeon Breast Muscle anyway, po. [Note: see her translated tweet.]

01:53 Others: (laughs)

01:57 Miku: How about you all, po?

02:00 Saiki: What?

02:01 Miku: How about you all, po? On today’s show.

02:04 Saiki: That was fun.

02:05 Kanami: It was fresh to me to chat.

02:09 Saiki: That was too fast, right?

02:11 Akane: Comments just flowed.

02:13 Saiki: Too fast. I was in the chat but all zipped away. I was like “Oh they are all gone!”

02:18 Others: (laughs)

02:20 Miku: Right, po. But when Sai-chan called “Mincho”, Mincho somehow captured it, that was amazing, po.

02:27 Kanami: No. She called me “Kanami”.

02:31 Saiki: I said “Kanami”.

02:32 Miku: That’s nice, po.

02:34 Kanami: I sent Sai-chan, “is this really you?” right?

02:37 Miku: Right.

02:38 Saiki: Yeah.

02:39 Miku: It’s nice she was real, po.

02:42 Others: (laughs)

02:44 Miku: Well, we’re glad if you all enjoyed it. Thank you very much for watching, po.

02:51 Miku: Now, we’d like to have a special program from now on, po.

02:59 Miku: We’d like to introduce highlights of the video we have just released, po.

03:05 Akane: Yay!

03:05 Saiki: Wow!

03:06 Miku: Because of the limited time, each of us is going to introduce only one scene. Each of you has selected one, po, right?

03:13 Others: Yes.

03:16 Miku: What do you think now after selecting yours, po?

03:19 Saiki: It was hard.

03:20 Miku: Yes. Sai-chan, you said it was hard, po.

03:23 Saiki: There are too many scenes to select from.

03:25 Miku: Right. This time, the video has so many highlights, more than any other work so far.

03:34 Saiki: It’s awesome, right? It’s well made.

03:37 Others: (laughs)

03:39 Miku: It’s awesome, po (laughs).

03:41 Miku: It’s well made for sure, po.

03:43 Akane: Yes.

03:44 Miku: So, this time, we’d like to share you the scenes we’ve selected, using the playback function of Zoom, po.

04:01 Miku: Well, this screen is small, and we’ll be glad if you watch the scenes again in your house, po. Please watch them, po.

04:10 Saiki: Please.

04:11 Miku: Now let’s get started, po. First, Sai-chan, go ahead please, po.

04:18 Saiki: Yes. There’s a scene where my heart skipped a beat…

04:22 Miku: Skipped a beat?

04:23 Saiki: That’s Screaming. In Screaming, I make eye contact with masters and princesses like this, right? There’s a scene that flows from me to Kobato, where each of us makes eye contact. I myself was doing it, but when I saw it, my heart skipped a beat…

04:46 Others: (laughs)

04:47 Saiki: I was like, “Oh, does everyone feel like this?”

04:50 Miku: Because you can’t see how you look from outside, po.

04:53 Saiki: Yeah, so I want you to watch it. Here it is.

(Screaming)

05:22 Saiki: Did you see that?

05:24 Akane: Ba-dump, ba-dump. My heart ba-dumps! [Note: she used the word トゥンク tunku, a new onomatopoeia for a throbbing heart popular among anime fans.]

05:28 Saiki: That’s nice. That’s really so.

05:31 Miku: Exactly. When I make eye contact with masters and princesses, I can’t help smiling, po, well, because masters and princesses also smile a lot and enjoy together with us.

05:46 Saiki: The scene reminded me of that, so I was glad.

05:50 Miku: Yeah, that’s fantastic for sure.

05:51 Saiki: That’s why I’ve selected it.

05:53 Miku: I see.

05:54 Akane: It’s fantastic.

05:54 Miku: I think it’s a fantastic scene, po.

05:58 Miku: So, now, next, let’s move on to the next, po.

06:03 Saiki: Yes. Who’s next?

06:04 Miku: Next, me, Kobato, po!

06:05 Akane: Yes!

06:06 Kanami: Please.

06:07 Miku: Now I can talk about it, po.

06:09 Saiki: Go ahead, Muscle!

06:10 Akane: Go ahead, Pigeon Muscle!

06:11 Miku: I, Muscle, selected… I’m not Muscle, po!

06:14 Others: (laughs)

06:15 Miku: I, Kobato, selected a scene whose title would be… “Will Kobato become an AI in the end, po?” po. You’ll understand it if you watch it. Here it is, po.

(Kobato Time)

07:19 Miku: Po!

07:21 Akane: Yeah! [Note: said in English.]

07:21 Saiki: Yeah! [Note: said in English.]

07:23 Akane: Yeah! Check it out, yo! [Note: said in English.]

07:25 Miku: We don’t know yet whose voice it is, po. Nobody knows it, po, right?

07:31 Kanami: No, we don’t know.

07:34 Miku: All of a sudden in the live performance… We decided to use sampling pads from this time, and in the dress rehearsal we were saying jokingly it would be funny to put Kobato’s voice in an unused slot, then it actually popped out in the live performance.

07:51 Akane: Right!

07:52 Others: (laughs)

07:53 Miku: I’m the one who was the most surprised, po. I didn’t know anything. I said “never do that in the live performance”, po, and you did it, seriously.

08:05 Kanami: That was fun.

08:07 Saiki: That was funny.

08:08 Miku: Masters and princesses responded to it much louder than to my voice…

08:15 Akane: They shouted loud.

08:17 Miku: I thought “What the heck is this, po?” And there was Misa-chan’s smile.

08:23 Others: (laughs)

08:24 Saiki: That was amazing. Her smile was shining.

08:27 Miku: Seriously. She doesn’t shine like that when she plays. She was drinking and she was like a drunkard.

08:36 Misa: [Note: I can’t hear well.]

08:38 Miku: [Note: I can’t hear well.]

08:41 Saiki: She was cute.

08:42 Miku: Yes, she was. Misa-chan, your smile made me relaxed, po. I saw your big smile.

08:50 Saiki: She’s embarrased. She hides her face.

08:54 Miku: We’ve watched Kobato’s favorite scene. Now, let’s move on to the next, po. Who’s next, po?

09:02 Kanami: Aye aye! [Note: aiyo in Japanese. It is an informal word for “yes” sometimes used by old commoners in Tokyo, which is funny because it doesn’t match her upper-class lady’s way of speaking. She also uses it in a video on Natalie.]

09:03 Miku: Po! Aye?

09:05 Saiki: Aye?

09:06 Miku: Then Kanami-san, go ahead please, po.

09:09 Kanami: I, Mincho, selected Wonderland. It will be a very heart-throbbing scene for Saiki enthusiasts.

09:15 Miku, Akane, Misa: (laughs)

09:22 Kanami: I should say it also in English. Here I go.

09:24 Kanami: My favorite video cen… scene is Wonderland! Saiki is soooooo cute! [Note: said in English.]

09:34 Others: (laughs)

09:36 Kanami: Here it is.

(Wonderland)

10:17 Kanami: See? This cuteness. This preciousness.

10:21 Miku, Akane, Misa: (laughs)

10:22 Kanami: If you understand it, raise your hand? Yes, yes, you understand it well as I expected.

10:27 Miku, Akane, Misa: (laughs)

10:27 Kanami: Her cute smiling face and somewhat sexy performance with her powerful singing voice are so seductive.

10:38 Others: (laughs)

10:41 Miku: Sai-chan, what do you think after hearing that, po?

10:46 Saiki: Well, that’s “kokoro”… what was that? “kokoro”…

10:52 Miku: “yurasarenai no” po?

10:54 Saiki: Yes, you’re talking about that part, probably.

10:57 Kanami: Maybe it’s your way of singing, but you kind of wink, right? [Note: Saiki winks at 9:54.]

11:03 Saiki: Ah, it’s my habit.

11:06 Kanami: Sai-chan, you say you don’t wink, but it looks like you wink, which is cute.

11:15 Others: (laughs)

11:17 Akane: I don’t get the meaning of what Kanami says, somehow.

11:19 Miku: I’m useless, po. But, Kanami-chan, I surely understood your love.

11:25 Saiki: Yeah.

11:26 Kanami: OK, here I go. In English. Saiki…

11:32 Miku: What’s wrong, po?

11:35 Kanami: I wonder how you say “I love you.”

11:39 Kanami: How do you say “I love you” in English?

11:42 Miku: That’s “I love you”, po. [Note: she said “I love you” in English.]

11:43 Kanami: Uh-huh, I see.

11:44 Others: (laughs)

11:45 Saiki: What?!

11:47 Miku: What’s happen [sic], po! [Note: said in English.]

11:50 Kanami: Saiki, I love you. [Note: said in English.]

11:53 Others: (laughs)

11:55 Miku: Now, let’s go to the next highlight introduction, po. So, Misa-chan, Misa-chan, go ahead please.

12:05 Misa: Yes, here I go. Mine is the intro of Play, and I want you to show the moment I myself gradually awakens. You’ll understand it if you watch it.

12:17 Saiki: I understand.

12:18 Misa: My facial expression becomes richer there.

12:21 Saiki: Yes.

12:22 Miku: Right.

12:23 Misa: Just for your information, I don’t have any memory after that moment.

12:26 Others: (laughs)

12:27 Saiki: What?! Was that so?

12:29 Miku: What? Was that so? That’s a shocking truth. Really?

12:33 Misa: Here it is.

(Play)

13:35 Miku: I see, po.

13:36 Misa: I was like that.

13:38 Miku: Misa-chan, you don’t have any memory after that, po?

13:42 Akane: Insane!

13:43 All: (laughs)

13:45 Saiki: I didn’t know that.

13:47 Miku: I didn’t know that, po.

13:49 Kanami: Our energy explodes up, right?

13:52 Others: (laughs)

13:55 Saiki: It explodes up.

13:57 All: (laugther)

13:59 Saiki: I understand what you mean.

14:01 Miku: I like how Kanami-chan explodes up in that part of Play, po.

14:08 Akane: She looks like playing with her face.

14:09 Miku: Yes, she looks so.

14:11 Kanami: Do you mean my facial expression very similar to my elder brother?

14:14 Others: (laughs)

14:15 Saiki: Yes, yes.

14:16 Miku: Do you look like your elder brother, po? You are a family, of course.

14:19 Saiki: They look so much alike.

14:20 Kanami: That face of mine looks very much like his.

14:23 Miku: Is that so? Then, we should watch that scene thinking like, “Ah, Kanami-chan’s elder brother looks like this”, po.

14:36 Saiki: Won’t he get mad? Your elder brother.

14:38 All: (laughs)

14:42 Miku: Is this OK, po?

14:43 Saiki: OK?

14:45 Kanami: No problem.

14:46 Miku: No problem?

14:47 Saiki: Really?

14:51 Miku: Misa-chan, you were turned on from that moment, po, right?

14:55 Misa: Yes.

14:56 Miku: I want everyone to look at Misa-chan there, po, and to realize like, “Ah, Misa doesn’t have any memory of this scene.”

15:05 All: (laughs)

15:08 Saiki: That’s insane, right? Everyone watches it and thinks like “she has no memory now.”

15:14 All: (laughs)

15:16 Misa: I kind of realized I was like that.

15:18 All: (laughs)

15:19 Miku: “I was like that.”

15:20 Saiki: Do you mean your memory is vague?

15:22 Misa: Right.

15:23 Miku: You just got drunk, po.

15:26 Misa: I watched it and I realized how I was.

15:28 Miku: Uh-huh.

15:29 Saiki: I see.

15:31 Miku: I kind of understand her feelings, po.

15:35 Saiki: I really understand.

15:36 Miku: After we all get excited and finish a serving, I sometimes forget about it completely for some reason, po.

15:44 Saiki: Quite often.

15:45 Miku: Like, “What? I don’t remember I played that song.”

15:50 Kanami: I understand.

15:51 Miku: That happens probably because when we play we enjoy a lot and we’re really concentrated, po.

16:02 Saiki: It’s funny.

16:04 Miku: It’s funny indeed, po.

16:04 Misa: That’s the live performance.

16:06 Miku: We all want to watch it and pay attention to Misa-chan, po, once again.

16:11 Misa: Check it out.

16:12 Miku: Check it out, po.

16:14 Miku: Now, let’s move on to the next, po.

16:17 Akane: Yes, the last one.

16:18 Miku: Ah-chan, you are the last one, po.

16:20 Akane: Yes, I also pick up Play.

16:24 Miku: Po.

16:26 Akane: Just before the last chorus, Sai-chan riles up the audience, and then Kobato shouts “Say!” with too much momentum (laughs). I really like it, so I want everyone to watch it.

16:39 Kanami: Yay!

16:40 Akane: Please watch Kobato’s greatest “Say!”

16:43 Kanami: Yay!

(Play)

17:07 Akane: Insane!

17:08 All: (laughs)

17:11 Saiki: So funny.

17:13 Kanami: Amazing.

17:14 Saiki: Your face is awesome.

17:16 Miku: Say!

17:19 Kanami: Amazing.

17:24 Akane: It’s always insane no matter how many times I watch it.

17:26 Kanami: I want to watch it many times.

17:27 Miku: Masters and princesses, listen to me, po. My bandmates are cruel, po. They captured this scene (laughs) and uploaded to our chat room on LINE, and they say they want to make a sticker, po.

17:44 Akane: We make a sticker, naturally.

17:45 Saiki: What’s wrong?

17:48 Kanami: Ah-chan made a temporary sticker and we use it quite often.

17:51 Misa: It says “Say!”

17:53 Saiki: I use it.

17:53 Akane: I use it.

17:54 Miku: You guys often make stickers of me in scenes like that.

18:02 Saiki: That’s nice. I want to watch “Say!” once again. One more time.

18:06 Kanami: Me too.

18:06 Miku: That’s enough, po.

18:08 Akane: Masters and princesses probably want to watch this “Say!” many times, so…

18:13 Miku: I don’t want to watch it, po.

18:15 Saiki: I want to watch it.

18:15 Akane: This time, we’ve prepared a special version of “Say!”. Please watch it.

18:19 Saiki: Sick.

(Say! ×3)

18:31 All: (laughs)

18:35 Miku: Hold on, hold on, po. You took the trouble to make it?

18:42 Others: (laughs)

18:44 Akane: Isn’t it insane?

18:45 Saiki: I want it! I just want that part.

18:50 Akane: And its title is “Razor Ramon Kobato”. [Note: Razor Ramon HG is a Japanese comedian. One of his well-known lines is “Say! Say! Say!”.]

18:55 All: (laughs)

18:57 Miku: Hey!

18:58 Saiki: It has even a title.

19:00 Miku: I’m not Razor Ramon, po.

19:03 Akane: I asked someone to make it.

19:04 Saiki: Sick.

19:08 Miku: You took the trouble… This time they edited the video for us very quickly, right, po?

19:19 Saiki: Yes.

19:21 Miku: So, they also edited this “Say! Say! Say!” very quickly, po.

19:27 Kanami: Thank you very much, beloved Band-Maid staff members.

19:32 Saiki: For your prompt action.

19:37 Miku: I want you to use it if you have a chance, because they took the trouble to make it.

19:44 Saiki: I want it! I want it!

19:46 Akane: I’ll ask them to send it to me.

19:47 Kanami: I want it.

19:48 Saiki: I want them to send it to me.

19:52 Miku: I have mixed feelings for this ending, po.

19:57 Saiki: Why?

19:58 Akane: It’s our signature.

19:59 Saiki: It works well as our signature.

20:01 Miku: I said “Say!” because I wanted everyone to sing, po.

20:07 Saiki: You didn’t do it that cute at all.

20:10 Akane: That face of yours.

20:11 Saiki: Your face.

20:12 Miku: I thought I just said “Say!”, po.

20:15 Kanami: As a result, those who bought a DVD/Blu-ray will watch it many times.

20:22 Miku: Do you mean ”Say!”?

20:24 Saiki: I want to tell them the exact position in minutes. Also the chapter so that they can go directly to it.

20:32 Miku: Ah-chan knows the position in minutes, po.

20:37 Saiki: If she took a memo.

20:38 Kanami: Well, the position in minutes is around…

20:41 Others: (laughs)

20:42 Kanami: Between 1 hour 29 minutes 30 seconds and 31 seconds.

20:46 Miku: That’s really pinpoint, po.

20:49 Saiki: Sick.

20:50 Miku: I want you to feel my momentum, po.

20:56 Akane: I felt it.

20:57 Saiki: I feel it. I felt it enough.

21:00 Akane: Those who came to see us felt it.

21:02 Saiki: I feel it. I feel it on my shoulders. The pigeon coos.

21:03 Others: (laughs)

21:05 Miku: It always ends by teasing me like this anyway, po.

21:09 Kanami: Your shoulders got wider.

21:11 Miku: It’s not that my shoulders got wider, po.

21:17 Miku: I’m Gundam Kobato. You should stop it, po.

21:20 Saiki: You have a lot of names.

21:22 Miku: Because masters and princesses give me new names, po.

21:29 Saiki: They understand your character.

21:32 Miku: That’s not good. Not good. I get sulky, po.

21:35 Saiki: That’s so good, right? So good.

21:38 Akane: You should appreciate it.

21:42 Saiki: Pigeon Breast Muscle.

21:44 Akane: It’s genius to name you Pigeon Breast Muscle.

21:48 Miku: Who is Pigeon Breast Muscle, po?

21:50 Akane: Pigeon Breast Muscle (laughs).

21:52 Miku: Muscles are important, po.

21:55 Saiki: Great.

21:56 Miku: What are we talking about, po?

22:01 Miku: Well, we’ve talked about our favorite scenes, po. What do you think, po? Your favorite scene is… (laughs)

22:12 Saiki: What happened? Kobato, what happened? Are you shaken up?

22:17 Miku: I’m shaken up naturally, po.

22:19 Miku: I’m shaken up because I watched “Say! Say! Say!” so many times, po.

22:22 Akane: Good luck! (laughs)

22:24 Saiki: We want everyone to watch our favorite scenes again.

22:28 Akane: Yes.

22:29 Miku: Yes, po. We also want to know masters and princesses’ favorite scenes if any.

22:37 Saiki: I want to know.

22:39 Miku: There might be new findings like “Oh, they love this scene!” po.

22:44 Miku: Masters and princesses, please watch the DVD and let us know, po. Please, po.

22:51 Saiki: Please.

22:52 Miku: That’s all for the highlights.

22:55 All: (Applause)

22:57 Miku: Now, it’s about time to move on to the second half, po. Lastly, there is a new annoucement from us Band-Maid.

23:10 Saiki: Wow.

23:11 Miku: Po. We have a new announcement, po. Now, here is a quiz for you, po. Ta-da! What day is May 10, po?

23:24 Saiki: Ding! Ding! Ding!

23:26 Miku: Saiki-san!

23:28 Kanami: Bzzt. Bzzt.

23:29 Saiki: The day of maid. It’s the day of maid.

23:31 Miku: Ding ding ding! Ding ding ding! Ding ding ding!

23:33 All: (Applause)

23:34 Miku: May 10 is meido [note: the Japanese word for “maid”], May and… it’s not May Day, po…

23:41 Others: (laughs)

23:43 Akane: Excuse me, madam, are you shaken up? Are you all right?

23:45 Saiki: Excuse me, madam, are you all right?

23:47 Miku: May is mei, 10th is tō, so it’s do, so they make meido, the day of maid, po. It’s not what we say by ourselves but it’s determined as the day of maid worldwide, po. [Note: Only in Japan actually.] Actually, to your surprise, we Band-Maid already reserved a venue in Tokyo a year ago, po.

24:10 Saiki: Yeah.

24:13 Miku: But, you know, we have in this situation, po. The world is in turmoil, kind of. In this situation we can’t do a serving carelessly, so it has become impossible to have the serving of the day of maid, po. To our regret, our great regret.

24:42 Miku: We’ve postponed the serving, po, but…

24:50 Miku: To your surprise! To your surprise!

24:53 Akane: To your surprise?

24:54 Miku: This year.

24:56 Saiki: What?

24:58 Misa: What?

24:59 Miku: We are having the Online Day of Maid, po!

25:05 Kanami: Say it again.

25:09 Miku: The Online Day of Maid.

25:11 Akane: Uh-huh. I see.

25:13 Miku: We’ll do it, po.

25:14 Saiki: I’m glad.

25:17 Miku: In this situation, everyone, we Band-Maid think your enjoyment must not be deprived of, po.

25:30 Miku: So, this year we’ve decided to present you a live streaming remotely.

25:35 Akane: Yay!

25:36 All: (Applause)

25:38 Saiki: Yay!

25:39 Miku: We Band-Maid will be glad if we can give you masters and princesses energy even just a little, po.

25:49 Miku: We’ll be glad if we can spend fun time together online with you masters and princesses who stay safe, stay home, po.

26:01 Akane: Yes.

26:03 Miku: We’re going to broadcast on YouTube this time too, and we will inform you of the details later on, po. Wait a moment please, po.

26:12 Miku: One more thing!

26:14 Miku: We’re going to release new merch we’ve made for this Day of Maid, po!

26:27 All: (Applause)

26:29 Miku: When you come to a serving, you get to want some merch naturally, po. We Band-Maid usually make new merch as a present and enjoyment for masters and princesses, so this time too, we will sell merch on the Day of Maid, po. Masters and princesses, please come back home online to the Band-Maid serving, po.

27:02 Saiki: Please.

27:05 Miku: We hope you all to look forward to it, po.

27:07 Akane: Yes.

27:07 Kanami: Yeah.

27:08 Saiki: I want them to see us.

27:10 Miku: Right. What kind of online serving should we do, po?

27:14 Akane: I wonder.

27:14 Saiki: I wonder.

27:15 Akane: What will be good?

27:17 Saiki: I wonder what will be good.

27:18 Miku: That’s to meet masters and princesses’ expectation, po. Since we aim at world domination, let’s do the best online serving ever to give energy to all the people, po.

27:34 Akane: Yes.

27:35 Miku: More precisely, the Online Day of Maid, not an online serving.

27:39 Akane: Yes.

27:40 Miku: Ah-chan, what do you think, po? How is your determination?

22:46 Akane: Like this! [Note: see the video.]

27:48 Others: (laughs)

27:49 Saiki: Insane! (laughs) You’re insane.

27:52 Akane: Did you get it?

27:53 Miku: Maybe it was my failure to ask Ah-chan, po.

27:57 Miku: Misa-chan, what do you think?

27:59 Misa: [Note: see the video.]

28:00 Others: (laughs)

28:02 Akane: You’re great as usual!

28:06 Miku: You two are the same, po.

28:09 Miku: Then Mincho-chan, what do you think?

28:12 Kanami: Probably like this. [Note: see the video.]

28:14 Others: (laughs)

28:18 Miku: You’re the best! The best, po.

28:22 Saiki: Where’s your head thing?

28:24 Miku: Mincho-chan, are you all right, po?

28:26 Kanami: Yeah.

28:28 Miku: Hey Misa-chan, don’t drink, po. What do you drink today, po?

28:33 Misa: This is shochu with soda.

28:35 Miku: So, you’re drinking shochu with soda, po (laughs).

28:39 Miku: You’re too free, po.

28:41 Kanami: I’m drinking barley tea.

28:43 Miku: So, you’re drinking barley tea, po.

28:47 Miku: Now, Saiki-sensei, … [Note: here she jokingly uses sensei for the boss.]

28:51 Saiki: What?

28:52 Miku: Saiki-sensei, for the Day of Maid, the online streaming on May 10, …

28:59 Saiki: Yes.

29:00 Miku: Please tell your determination, or your message to masters and princesses, po.

29:04 Saiki: Well, this is our first try of an online serving, so we want to do something you can enjoy only online, and we’ll decide it in meetings with all of us members and Band-Maid staff members.

29:26 Miku: Well, everyone, please don’t miss it, po. Masters and princesses, have a nice day! That’s all from Band-Maid, po. Bye-bye kuruppo!

29:37 Akane: Bye-bye!
