How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

The character that represents my goal of this year is “癒” [note: “soothe”, “heal”].

While difficult times continue, I’d like to do my best to do what I can do now and soothe people’s hearts through Band-Maid.

However, I also want to spend my time without forgetting to soothe my own heart.

I want to be soothed by Sai-chan.

Everyone, let’s make this year a fantastic one.
