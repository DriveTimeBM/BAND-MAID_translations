I’m Akane.

Speaking of February, there was a big event for girls, Valentine’s Day, right?

Did you all receive or give chocolates?

As for me, I bought myself chocolates and canelés.

I’ve been eating more sweets recently.

I remembered the chocolates and cakes I ate in the scene of Don’t you tell ME where I snitch them were extremely delicious, so I chose Don’t you tell ME for my “Song of the Month”!

See you!
