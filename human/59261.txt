How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

Now, here’s a pop quiz. What’s Mincho’s choice for the song of July?

I’ll give you a hint. The song was released on July 25, 2018.

Also, when we had a meeting for a next song, we decided to write a song everyone can sing…, and we wrote it.

Does anyone know what song it is?

The correct answer is Start over. Please listen to it.
