Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

Kobato’s Song of the Month is Smile, po.

We’re having quite hard time, and I feel lonely…

I remember I wrote the lyrics of Smile by thinking about you masters and princesses, and that reminds me of servings at that time, po!

I want to do servings in front of you all as soon as possible, po.

When we see again, let’s show our big smiles to each other, po!

Bye-bye, po!
