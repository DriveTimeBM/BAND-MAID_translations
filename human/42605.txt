I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

Today I’d like to introduce Misa.

Misa drinks whiskey on stage so you might think she is so cool and stylish, but actually she usually does funny things to me and she acts sweet when she gets drunk, so she’s cute and I like her.

When I send her a song, she immediately sends me a bass line, so she’s quick at work and my best partner of composition.

That’s all.
