This is a skit Akane and Saiki did at Kumamoto B.9 V1 on December 1, 2018. Kumamoto Surprise is the theme song of Kumamon, a mascot character of Kumamoto Prefecture, where Miku was born.

The whole video is a parody of The Professionals, a documentary on professionals on NHK. Akane intentionally talks like a veteran dancer.
