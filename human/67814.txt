Hi, I’m Misa.

My “Song of the Month” is Play.

I’ve been watching live videos on YouTube recently, and that made me want to play Play in front of you all as soon as possible.

We’ve played a lot of arrangements in the intro of Play, right?

How many arrangements are there actually? I don’t remember.

Please someone tell me.

This is a picture of an ozoni I ate on New Year’s Day.

Well then, see you.
