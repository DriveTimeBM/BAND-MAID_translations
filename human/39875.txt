00:00 Hi, I’m Misa!

00:02 Today I’d like to make side dishes.

00:05 Now I cut onions.

00:11 Now I cut a daikon.

00:15 I’m cutting carrots. Into large chunks.

00:20 I’m cutting chicken. I’ve already removed the skin.

00:24 I’ll use the skin for another dish later.

00:30 Cheers! [Note: she drinks beer while cooking.]

00:37 Ahh. Whew, it’s so good!

00:41 Now I add green beans too.

00:44 I don’t have cooking saké [note: cheaper saké for cooking] so I just add ordinary saké.

00:47 I’m boiling them together. The beer tastes great.

00:54 As for the chicken skin I removed a little while ago, I’ve skewered it with garlics and garlic scapes, and I’m pan-frying them like yakitori.

01:03 Now the dishes are ready! Today I made a nimono, and kushiyaki of chicken skin, garlics, and garlic scapes.

01:15 Well then, let’s eat.

01:16 I’ll start with beer.

01:24 Ahh.

01:27 Let’s eat. [Note: she eats some of the nimono.]

01:38 Tee hee. It’s tasty.

01:47 This time, the reason why I’ve added garlics and garlic scapes is to improve my immunity.

01:55 Let’s eat. [Note: she eats a pan-fried garlic.]

02:03 It tastes good.

02:04 Everyone, enjoy your time staying at home!

02:08 See you!
