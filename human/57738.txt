How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

I introduce my “Song of the Month”!

I think it rains often in June, but since I have made it a habit to drink café au lait on a rainy day, I quite like rainy days.

I think I wrote this song when it was raining, so please listen to it with a cup of café au lait today.

Mirage!
