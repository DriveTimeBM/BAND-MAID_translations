Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

My “Song of the Month” is Alone, po.

Speaking of February, we had Valentine’s Day, po, didn’t we?

I buy myself Morozoff and Miffy’s collab chocolates every year, po, but this year so sadly I couldn’t buy one, so I baked cookies for myself for the first time in a while, po.

I bought a Miffy cookie cutter and drew the faces with an icing pen, but it was so hard to balance the eyes, po!

That made me want to try once again, po.

Bye-bye, po.
