Kuruppo! O-mei-syu-sama, I’m Miku Kobato, po. Everyone, how are you doing lately, po?

Every day at home, I play the guitar, play with my affectionate Tora, make meals, po.

And I do myofascial release, play PUBG, and so on. I somehow enjoy my home life.

It’s still a tough time now, but let’s stay safe, stay home and work hard at it.

Bye-bye, po!
