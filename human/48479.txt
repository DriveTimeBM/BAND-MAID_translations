This is my third Q&A. There were extremely many people asking me the same question.

“Are you in love with someone?”

Say what?

I’m not in love. I’m not seeing anyone. I have no chance to meet new people. I don’t meet anyone but my bandmates. I’m not popular.

Hmm, that might be because of myself… whoa, whoa, there’s only one second left, whoa, um…

I’M OUTTA HERE!!!!
