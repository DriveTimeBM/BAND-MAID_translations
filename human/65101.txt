Hello, o-mei-syu-sama. I’m Saiki.

Um, I’ve chosen Corallium for my “Song of the Month”.

Um, Corallium is the song I wrote entire lyrics to for the first time. Have you listened to it a lot?

I chose it because I’d like you to listen to it a lot also this month.

I think it matches perfectly with the coming cold winter!

Well then, bye.
