Hello, o-mei-syu-sama. I’m Saiki.

How are you?

Um, as my “Song of the Month”, I’ve chosen Decided by myself.

Um, when the air begins to change like this and I feel the change of seasons, somehow I hear its intro in mind, so I’ve chosen it.

O-mei-syu-sama, please listen to it.

That’s all from Saiki.

Bye-bye.
