Hi, I’m Misa. This is a question from Maru-san.

“I’m a beginner bassist. What should I practice first? By the way, I bought a 5-string bass.”

In my case, when I was a beginner, I started it by practicing songs of my favorite artists.

It’s absolutely important to first know the fun of bass sounds and the good feel of string vibrations when you play it.

Also, there are a lot of basic practice videos uploaded on YouTube, so you can practice with them, I think.

You’re great to have chosen a 5-string bass (laughs).

Thank you for your question. Bye-bye.
