Welcome back home, masters, princesses, and o-mei-syu-sama!

Kuruppo! I’m Miku Kobato, po!

We, Miku Kobato and Torao, this pigeon and this cat, are bringing our first Maid’s Room to you, po!

Nice to meet you, po!

So, everyone, what are you doing recently, po?

Do you “stay home, stay safe” well, po?

Tora-san has just gone away, so I, Kobato, would like to continue it by myself, po.

So, in this program, I’d like to introduce you my favorite movies, po.

When I write lyrics, I often see movies and get inspirations from there, and that sometimes leads to my lyrics, so I love seeing a lot of movies, po.

I’ll be glad if you masters and princesses could see movies I recommend while you “stay home, stay safe”, po.

Now, in the first episode, the film I recommend to you is… ta-da! Shall We Dance?, po! Clap clap clap clap clap!

Shall We Dance? is a Japanese film released in 1996, or in the 8th year of Heisei, po.

Everyone, do you know it, po?

Though some of you might not know it, it’s a heart-warming comedy film. But it’s not just a heart-warming comedy film, po!

I saw Shall We Dance? for the first time when I was small, and I thought, “What a fantastic movie, po!” and now I don’t remember how many times I’ve rewatched it, po.

I saw it again and again until the video tape was almost worn out, po.

I remember I was amazed by it also because my mom used to do “Shall We Dance?” [note: ballroom dance], po.

Above all, the lead actor Kōji Yakusho-san is really amazing, po!

You know what? There’s a scene where he’s stepping without even noticing in his office, po, and that’s so fantastic, po.

It’s one of the films I’d really like you masters and princesses to see and share, po!

Please see it, po!

That’s all from Miku Kobato and Torao, po.

Bye-bye kuruppo!
