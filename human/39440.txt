O-mei-syu-sama, hi, I’m Saiki.

I do what I can do to improve myself at home these days.

I continue body training because I love it, but I also try my best to train my sense of tone to sing better, using a keyboard.

Now we are having a very tough time, but we must work hard at it together, right?

Let’s do our best so that we can meet at the serving safely.

See you.
