Kuruppo! O-mei-syu-sama, I’m Kobato, po.

Today’s theme is my behind-the-scenes story of “The Day of Maid”, po.

This time I appeared also as Cluppo in the opening act, po.

To my surprise, when I did Cluppo, my bandmates watched me from the audience side, po. I was happy, po!

But by seeing them, I rather got very nervous, po.

Also, every time I started dancing in the chorus, I threw away the pick I was holding, po.

Did any of you notice that, po?

Well then, po, bye-bye, po!
