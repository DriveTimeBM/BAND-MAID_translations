Hello, I’m Misa.

This time, as for my “Song of the Month”, I asked my bandmates to choose for me, because it’s my birth month.

They have chosen the song with chic bass, The Dragon Cries.

Somehow it already feels nostalgic.

Everyone, please listen to it.

By the way, it’s a photo of a record/multi-player I got recently.

I’m getting into vinyls.

Well then, see you.
