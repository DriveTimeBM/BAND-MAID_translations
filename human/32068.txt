00:18 [Caption] Q: What kind of song is Endless Story?

00:18 Misa: It’s a magnificent song. It’s like this, just like this.

00:30 Kanami: Now we will go on a picnic together.

00:34 Kanami: Now let’s go on a picnic.

00:42 Staff: It’s dangerous. Please be careful.

00:47 [Caption] Q: Tell us your determination today.

00:47 Saiki: Well… This is our second time filming at sea, but it feels completely different than the previous one, so I’m looking forward to it, and I think it’s perfect for the song! I will do my best!

01:21 [Caption] (Akane expresses the beat of the waves with her body)

01:28 Akane: The beat of the waves.

01:31 Kanami: What did you say? The beat of the waves?

01:38 Kanami: What’s the beat of the wave?

01:41 Kanami: What’s the beat of the wave?

01:42 Kobato: What?

01:44 Kanami: What’s the beat of the wave?

01:46 Kobato: The beat of the waves? She personified it, po, right? The feeling of the waves. Did you say “beat”? You personified it as a living thing, po, right? Ah-chan, you’re great as usual (unimpressed).

01:58 [Caption] (The chorus part was shot like this)

02:14 [Caption] (Kobato’s joking time)

02:14 Kobato: Well, today, we’re doing an acoustic concert in front of the waves together (laughs), in Oshima, like this, at the seashore, po.

02:27 Kobato: Right? Saiki-sensei?

02:30 Kobato: To this acoustic concert today, well, two people came to see us (laughs).

02:37 Saiki: Only two people came to see us (laughs).

02:39 Kobato: We’re doing our best by remembering our beginner’s spirit, po.

02:42 Akane: More people came.

02:43 Kobato: Now we have an audience of four, po.

02:46 Kobato: But we have an awkward distance from the audience. Maybe they still have a fear of approaching us… po.

02:59 Saiki: Hey, you’ve laid eggs.

03:01 Kobato: I’ve laid a lot of eggs! Oh! I have to bury them! [Like a mother turtle.]

03:04 Saiki: Bury them!

03:05 Kobato: I have to bury them.

03:06 Saiki: Crows will take them (laughs). Crows will take them.

03:09 Kobato: Before crows find them!!!

03:12 [Caption] (Kanami doesn’t miss practice during free time)

03:16 Kanami: Oh! There’s a grain of rice on my clothes!

03:43 Kanami: She’s cute.

03:44 Kanami: My girl is very cute.

04:17 Akane: It’s Day 2.

04:18 Kanami: It’s Day 2. Well, today, we came to the desert to camp together.

04:27 Kanami: We are going to make a fire.

04:29 Akane: Fire? There’s no wood (laughs).

04:39 [Caption] Q: It’s Day 2 of filming.

04:39 Kobato: Yes, it’s Day 2, po. We are in a place that doesn’t look like Japan, po. If someone said “This is Australia”, you would be like “Oh, I see”, po (laughs). I’m like “Where am I? Who am I?”, po. I’ll do my best. Po.

04:57 [Caption] (The insects won’t leave the outfit)

04:58 Kobato: I hate insects… Eww, you’ve been following me. Po. Po (laughs).

05:11 Kobato: What the heck is this, po?

05:13 Staff: Isn’t it because your outfit is white?

05:15 Kobato: Is it because this is white? Are they coming because this is white, po?

05:18 Staff: They gather to something bright.

05:19 Kobato: Aha. But it’s bright enough outside, po.

05:22 [Caption] (Akane asks the staff to shoot)

05:24 Akane: Around here?

05:33 [Caption] (Have you noticed?…)

05:35 [Caption] (Misa is behind her…)

06:01 Misa: It felt so nice to be able to play in the middle of nature like this.

06:11 [Caption] (The band’s chiropractor Miku Kobato)

06:11 Kobato: Um, now, I’m stretching the muscles of her shoulder blades, po. Um, first, loosen up the stiffness of your back, then move your shoulders like this, and you can move them more easily, po, right? Ah-chan, you…

06:23 Akane: Ouch! Ouch! (laughs)

06:24 Kobato: You have stiffness here, in the front, so I’ll loosen the stiffness well.

06:30 Kobato: It looks like this part is pretty tired because of drumming, po.

06:31 Akane: Ouch.

06:37 Akane: Ouch.

06:38 Kobato: I sometimes release her daily stress like this…

06:41 Akane: Just now you did it intentionally…

06:44 [Caption] (Akane mimics Miku Kobato)

07:01 Akane: Thank you very much, po (Kobato style)

07:05 Kanami: Today, we all came to play in the sand.

07:11 Kanami: Everyone, let’s make a castle.

07:14 [Caption] (She plays with the sand, and all the others lecture her)

07:26 Kobato: It’s insane, your face looks really hopeless.

07:28 Saiki: What are you gonna do with your hands?

07:32 Akane: She wiped them! She wiped them!

07:34 Kobato: Stop it! Don’t wipe your hands with her outfit, po.

07:37 Kobato: She gets mad, see, po?

07:39 Misa: Hey.

07:42 Misa: Hey. (As if she is making provocations)

07:53 [Caption] (This time, we also filmed with a drone)

07:53 Staff: Now let’s shoot.

08:01 [Caption] (Saiki always works out)

08:09 [Caption] (Her sudden workout lecture)

08:09 Saiki: Rather than effective on muscles…

08:13 Saiki: Here, between the lower muscles and the upper muscles, there are connecting big muscles. I’m stretching them.

08:27 Saiki: The point is that breathing is important (laughs).

08:39 Saiki: It hurts if you stretch them suddenly, so do it slowly, within your range, please!

08:50 Akane: Yes!

08:53 [Caption] (The band’s chiropractor Miku Kobato Part 2)

08:53 Kobato: Your right shoulder is pretty stiff, po. You hold the heavy bass, so it’s stiff, po.

09:01 Kobato: This is so stiff, po.

09:03 Misa: Argh…

09:04 Akane: “Argh”.

09:05 Kobato: (laughs)

09:06 Misa: Ugh…

09:08 Kobato: Your upper arms are fluffy, po (laughs).

09:12 Kobato: Oh.

09:13 Akane: Oh. Uh-huh.

09:18 Misa: You’re handsome! (laughs)

09:19 [Caption] (Kobato was much more awesome.)

09:23 [Caption] (Akane’s singing lecture)

09:28 Saiki: It’s coming!

09:30 Akane: Yeah~!

09:34 Saiki: She’s tone deaf like shit (laughs).

09:36 Kobato: (laughs)

09:38 Akane: Yeah~!

09:48 Saiki: OK, you don’t have to sing.

09:50 Saiki: Oh, it’s over (laughs).

09:52 Akane: Because I knew it was going to be quiet.

09:55 [Caption] (Kobato’s last cut)

10:03 Kobato: Po!

10:12 Kobato: It’s over, po. It didn’t look like filming in Japan, po.

10:23 Kobato: I’m competely sure it will be a good video. They say Saiki-sensei will finish it all, po. Po.

10:33 Kobato: Now, I, Kobato, will fly back to Tokyo, po. Po! Thank you very much, po, po~!

10:59 Staff: Cut! OK!

11:09 Saiki: Good job today. Thank you very much.

11:15 Saiki: It was hard because the wind was so strong, but this magnificent land combined with Endless Story will make it really great work, I suppose. I hope so!

11:35 Saiki: Thank you very much. Good-bye.
