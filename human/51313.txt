Yoo-hoo! I’m Misa.

This is a behind-the-scenes story of Unseen World, and, um, I’m the one who wrote the difficult bass lines, and, well… when I played in ensemble with them all in the studio, the phrases were so busy and the tempo was so fast, I couldn’t take my eyes off my hands in quite a lot of songs, as of now, so, hmm, they are so difficult my miss rate might increase if I get drunk at concerts (laughs).

Well, that’s my behind-the-scenes story.

I’ll work a little harder on it until the concert so that I grow to be able to take my eyes off my hands.

Well then, bye-bye!
