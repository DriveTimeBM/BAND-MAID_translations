“Sai-chan, you look really fantastic when you play the piano. Do you have a plan to upload videos of your play from now on too?”

Now… well, nothing as of now. But please look forward to it.

As for practicing the piano, um, I started it seriously after we finished the serving at Shibuya Public Hall [Line Cube Shibuya].

The reason why I started it is, um, because I wanted to take myself to the next level. Yes.
