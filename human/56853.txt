I’m Akane.

My “Song of the Month” is NO GOD.

My passion for servings and the drums doesn’t fade even after “The Day of Maid”, and I’m like “I want to improve like this by the next serving” and “I can do it better”, so the lines “Enjoyment wins the war / I can choose wherever I go” and “Break down my limits / On to the other side and beyond” in NO GOD really resonate with me now. That’s why I chose NO GOD.

Everyone, please listen to it!

See you.
