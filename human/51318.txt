Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po!

If I choose a character for my goal of this year, it will be “挑” that means “challenge”, “try”, po.

In 2021, I want to try more and more new things, po.

I’ll make this year a year of moving straight ahead, without being pessimistic even in this situation, po!

Everyone, I’m looking forward to seeing you this year too, po!

That’s all from Kobato, po.
