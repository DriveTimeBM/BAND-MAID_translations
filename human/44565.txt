Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po!

I’ll answer a question also today.

A question from Master Takka: “Please tell us your favorite G1 race and your favorite among the great horses in the past” po.

I love Gold Ship best, po. He’s a very strong but moody and difficult horsie, po.

At the Tenno Sho in spring 2015, he refused to enter the gate for a while and I got anxious, but once the race was started, he ran on the far outside from post 1 and won, po.

That race was a masterpiece, po.

He’s a horsie with too many legends, po.

If you don’t know about him, please check him out on YouTube, po.

So, bye-bye, po!
