Masters and princesses, how are you? I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

I spend days of practice and songwriting at home.

I always keep snacks with me while writing songs, but a while ago I ran out all the snacks in my house.

And Mincho thought to herself, “if you don’t have a snack, you can make your own.”

So, I made madeleines for the first time in a few years. They tasted so good!

Happy ever after.

See you later.
