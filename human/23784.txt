00:00 Today, today… this time, I’m doing this, po, while expecting how much difference you at Osaka can show, po.

00:07 Omajinai Time!

00:11 I’ve just raised the bar, po. Please clear the bar, po!

00:18 By the way, are there masters and princesses doing Omajinai Time for the first time?

00:24 Oh, not so many, there’ll be no problem, po.

00:26 I want to hear your voice louder than I expect, po.

00:30 Please repeat words after me, like, when I say “Moe moe”, you masters and princesses will say “Moe moe”, and when I say “Kyun kyun”, you will say “Kyun kyun”, po.

00:40 Are you ready, po?

00:43 Hey, look, you’re already reluctant, po.

00:45 You’re not allowed to be reluctant, po! I won’t stop until you shout loud, po!

00:50 Here we go, po!

00:52 Moe moe!

00:55 You’re still not doing your best, po.

00:57 Not yet, not yet, Osaka hasn’t shown it yet, po.

01:00 Moe moe!

01:03 Kyun kyun!

01:05 Moe moe!

01:07 Kyun kyun!

01:20 Nandeyanen! [Note: “What the hell?”, a typical phrase said by a straight man to a funny man in an Osaka-style comic duo.]

01:22 Nandeyanen!

01:24 Once more, nandeyanen!

01:27 Band-Maid!

01:30 Band-Maid!

01:31 Don’t be shy to say it! Band-Maid!

01:34 Last! Band-Maid!
