Kuruppo! I’m Kobato, po.

For my “Song of the Month”, I’ve chosen a song that would make you hot against cold weather, Hibana, po.

This is a picture of nimono of daikon, a dish I always want to make in a cold night.

I, Kobato, boil ume plums together and eat them.

If you have an upset stomach, eating it will make you feel better, po.

Well then, everyone, let’s keep going even under the cold weather, po!

Bye-bye kuruppo!
