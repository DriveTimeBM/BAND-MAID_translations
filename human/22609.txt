00:01 Now I’ll unbox this first-press limited edition A of Start over to be released on July 25, po!

00:11 The box is also cute because we didn’t compromise on it, po.

00:13 When you open it, first you’ll find a lyric sheet, po!

00:16 And… po? po? po? A lot of things come out, po.

00:20 And this CD, this DVD, and MAIKO lips, po. Po!

00:26 And, ta-da! These 22 postcards are included in it, po. A lot of cards of my bandmates are there too, po.

00:32 Everyone, please pay attention to them, po.

00:35 It would be cute to display them on the wall, po!

00:38 All right, everyone, please get one, po! Po!
