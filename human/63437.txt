How are you? I’m Kanamincho.

This month has Misa-chan and Koba-san’s birthdays! That calls for a celebration.

At this moment, it’s really hard for us members to gather and celebrate that, but I hope the day will come again when we can drink together at an izakaya or something and have a great time while getting drunk.

This month, I’ve selected a song I’d like to play if we had a chance to do a serving.

CLANG!
