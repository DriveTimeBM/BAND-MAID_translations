Masters and princesses, how are you? I’m Kanamincho.

Well, last time, I released a video of brewing coffee. Have you watched it yet?

Well, also, in my voice message, I told you I had made madeleines, and today, you’ll be surprised, I made a banana cake!

So I’ll bring it here!

Ta-da!

I baked it very well!

Now, let’s cut it and try some.

It’s ready! My banana cake!

Now, let’s eat it right away.

Umph.

Mmm! Mmm.

Mmm.

Wow! It’s delicious!

Actually, I learned my mother’s secret recipe from her and made it, so its taste reminds me of her home cooking. It tastes fantastic.

Recently, um, I can’t see my bandmates, and I don’t have a lot of occasions to talk, so I’m getting worse and worse at speaking.

However, I sometimes have video calls with them and enjoy practicing and songwriting.

That’s all.
