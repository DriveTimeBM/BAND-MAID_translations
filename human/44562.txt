00:00 Everyone, hello. I’m Misa.

00:02 Well, today, I’d like to briefly explain my techniques of picking to slapping and slapping to picking I often use while I play. Please listen.

00:15 First, this is my pick. I haven’t explained so much about my pick, so I explain it here. My pick is a little bigger than ordinary picks, a little, a little bit bigger.

00:34 In addition, it’s not so hard. It has a hardness between the green and the yellow Dunlop picks you often see at instrument stores.

00:48 Well, I’d like to explain simply first, so I’ll do it while showing the pick.

00:55 First, I’m holding the pick like this.

00:59 Like this? Can you see this better?

01:02 I’m holding it like this.

01:05 I’m playing.

01:08 Now I hold it here.

01:12 From here like this to here.

01:23 So, give it a try.

01:25 Now, I’d like to actually play the bass.

01:30 It’s a repetition like this.

01:39 So, first, I’d like to play the bass slowly to the A-melody of Bubble.

02:04 A phrase like that.

02:06 Can you see it?

02:08 Since Bubble has a slow tempo, I think it’s easy to practice.

02:14 Now, I’ll do it while playing the song.

02:36 Like that.

02:39 By the way, without holding it here, you can play it only by pulling.

02:46 For example…

02:54 Like that. While holding it here, I pull with my middle finger.

03:07 You can do it like that.

03:10 Well, next, I’ll show you Wonderland whose tempo is similar to Bubble.

03:18 I’ll play to the song. I’ll play the A-melody.

04:01 Well, like that.

04:04 If I play it slowly…

04:16 Like that.

04:27 In this floating moment, I’m holding it here.

04:32 Well, so, today, this time, that’s all. Next time, it’ll be nice if I can do an Instagram Live somewhere together.

04:42 Let’s keep practicing this together.

04:46 See you again somewhere. Bye-bye!
