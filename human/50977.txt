00:00 O-mei-syu-sama, I’m Saiki.

00:06 All right, this time too, I’ll introduce sneakers.

00:12 It’s Nike also today.

00:17 I’d like to introduce Nike sneakers.

00:24 The box is pure white.

00:28 The sneakers I introduce this time are a birthday present Ah-chan, Kanami-chan, and Misa-chan gave to me two years… two or three years ago.

00:49 Here they are.

00:55 These are Air Force 1 again.

01:03 I’m not sure about this because it was a while ago, but these Air Force 1 were designed for women, easy for women to wear or something like that, and there were several types.

01:32 There were 5 or 6 types, and these were from my bandmates, but I, Sai-chan, also got a different type of the same series myself, so I’ll show them someday.

01:58 And these are named Nike Air Force 1 Jester, and they are different from the ordinary Air Force 1, like this heel part has a thick sole, and can you see the side mark is shifted like this?

02:24 Like it’s shifted, and like this one on the heel part is shifted down.

02:35 And they are light.

02:37 The weight is light.

02:40 These are really the first Jester sneakers to be released, but they must have been popular.

02:54 There were various colors, and many of you must have seen them.

03:01 There were all-wh… white ones, and also pretty flashy ones, and they are so popular.

03:11 I, Sai-chan, love this cute color I can’t quite describe, neither white nor gray.

03:23 Thanks, my bandmates.

03:26 I wear them while taking care of them.

03:28 All right. They are Air Force 1 made for women, and, you know, Air Force 1 is a legendary icon of streetwear.

03:47 I have the impression that these Air Force 1 have a feminine atmosphere, or a light feel? like using this high-quality leather, and they are graceful.

04:09 Other than the box, a pouch? a drawstring pouch is also included. It’s cute, right?

04:24 That’s all about the sneakers I got from my bandmates.

04:33 Bye-bye.
