This time too, I’d like to answer one of the questions you sent.

“If the five of you cosplay as Sailor Moon characters, what combination will that be?”

So, in my personal opinion,

Kobato is Sailor Chibi Moon,

Misa-chan is Sailor Pluto,

Ah-chan is Sailor Jupiter,

Kanami-chan is Sailor Neptune,

and me, Sai-chan, will choose Sailor Mars.
