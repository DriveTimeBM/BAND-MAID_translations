I’m Kanami, the guitarist.

Today, I introduce Kobato.

She is very sincere and very very cute.

She always works hard at playing the guitar, singing, and writing lyrics.

But she looks scary when she just wakes up.

She always looks suffering when she sleeps.

She always makes something and brings it to us members on Valentine’s Day, but this year she didn’t make anything.

Kobato, please make something next time.

That’s all.

See you again.
