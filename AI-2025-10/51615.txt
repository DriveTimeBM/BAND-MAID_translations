💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Saiki (8 of 10)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. It’s Saiki.

If I were to express my goal for this year in one kanji character,
it would be 「楽」 (raku / ease, joy).

Even in times like these, I want to make music without unnecessary pressure—
to simply enjoy it freely and naturally.

I’m looking forward to being able to deliver songs to all of you again soon.

Goodbye.
