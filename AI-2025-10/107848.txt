[Unknown Speaker]
And then, starting in July — the summer festival season began!

[Unknown Speaker]
Jaga Rock Festival!

[Unknown Speaker]
Right, Jaga Rock. It was insanely hot that month, wasn’t it?

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, July was brutal. Every year I think, “Was it always this hot?” but it’s just getting worse each summer. Like setting a new record every year.

[Unknown Speaker]
From there, in August — oh wait, the “Choose Me” music video came out, right?

[Unknown Speaker]
Was that in August? I seriously don’t remember anymore.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, I can’t remember either. It started with that cool scream part, right?

[Unknown Speaker]
The scream — yeah, that was right! Such a cool music video. Okay, let’s eat!

So after that came the summer festivals — Rising Sun and Summer Sonic. Both were insanely hot, right?

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, Rising Sun was in a tent, so it was like a sauna.  
Summer Sonic was indoors, but somehow *still* that hot.  
Even our chief manager got heatstroke!

[Unknown Speaker]
Oh right, that was scary.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, we were so worried — about the audience too. Everyone was in danger of overheating.

[Unknown Speaker]
At Summer Sonic, there wasn’t enough flooring — I almost fainted. Everything went white for a moment.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, your face went completely pale right after we finished.

[Unknown Speaker]
I thought it was just excitement — like festival adrenaline!

[Unknown Speaker]
Nope, definitely not that (laughs). You were totally out of it.

[Unknown Speaker]
I remember telling you to drink so much water — “Drink! Hurry! Sports drink now!” I was like a mom (laughs). But it just shows how fun it was — that we pushed ourselves that hard.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, it really was fun. We’ve done Summer Sonic a few times, but that was the most packed crowd yet.

[Unknown Speaker]
All the way to the back — I was so happy.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, and the call-and-response was amazing! The audience sang so loud.

[Unknown Speaker]
Summer festivals are so different from one-man lives — it’s extra special when new people who’ve never seen us get into it.  
This year, I felt like our crowd kept growing at every festival.

[Unknown Speaker]
Totally — you could literally *see* more people coming in during each song.

[Unknown Speaker]
It’s so rewarding when you can actually see that from the stage. And yes, we can see you, po! Don’t think you’re invisible (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, faces are more visible than people realize. We can spot the movement, and it’s fun to watch.

[Unknown Speaker]
So yes — it was a super fun summer festival season!

Then in August, we did the “Medium in Summer” special show.  
The entire setlist was medium-tempo songs only — that was tough!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, that was really hard — but also something only possible now.  
We didn’t even have that many medium songs five years ago.

[Unknown Speaker]
It felt fresh — visually stunning too, with all the lighting and colors.  
We were nervous when releasing *Epic Narrative*, but now it’s really paying off.  
So, August was “Medium in Summer.” Then September brought “Treasure.”

[Unknown Speaker]
Treasure was the last summer festival — and even though it was September, it was insanely hot.

[Unknown Speaker]
And that’s where the “Akane Incident” happened!

[Unknown Speaker]
Confession time (laughs).

[Akane]
Yes… I woke up *at* the Shinkansen meeting time.

[Unknown Speaker]
So basically… you overslept.

[Unknown Speaker]
Big time (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
When I called to ask if you were coming, you answered with that classic half-asleep “Huh? I just woke up…” voice.

[Unknown Speaker]
We all panicked. But Kanami and I coordinated super fast — she contacted staff immediately, and somehow we figured out a plan in five minutes!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, they told me if I caught a taxi and got on at the next stop, I could still make it.  
So I literally ran out the door — five minutes flat.

[Unknown Speaker]
And you made it — that was impressive. You even made rehearsal.

[Unknown Speaker]
We helped you get dressed like a pit crew — “Okay, shirt! In-ears! Go!” (laughs)

[Akane]
Yeah, it was chaos — but somehow perfect. I felt like an athlete in a relay race.

[Unknown Speaker]
But you played so well that day — maybe because the tension was gone.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, I actually think it helped! Less time to overthink.

[Unknown Speaker]
So that was the “Akane Incident.” But that same month, *Epic Narrative* finally released!  
We’d been working on it for over three years. It became such an essential part of our Okyuji set now.

[Unknown Speaker]
The album art is so cool too — I have it displayed at home. It’s just perfect.

[Unknown Speaker]
Then in October, the “Forbidden Tale” MV was released, and we did the *Produced by Members* Okyuji!  
Each member made their own setlist and produced the show.

[Unknown Speaker]
That was wild — everyone’s reactions when they heard about it were hilarious. “Wait, what?!” (laughs)

[Unknown Speaker]
We all went all-out — like, “If we’re doing this, let’s go big!”  
There were so many unique choices, and even full-on jam sessions in every set.

[Unknown Speaker]
The guitar parts were intense too — so many solos! Kobato went full guitar hero mode.

[Unknown Speaker]
It was so fun though, seeing everyone’s reactions from the front.

[Unknown Speaker]
Then November — the Zepp Tour!  
We started in Nagoya, then Osaka, then Haneda — and Haneda was *two days*!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, that was our first two-day show there.  
The second day really showed how much we’d grown since Maid Day.  
The setlist included special session sections too — it was exhausting but fun!

[Unknown Speaker]
And that month was also Kanami’s PRS signature model release — congratulations!

[Kanami]
Thank you! I was so nervous, but seeing everyone come to the event made me so happy.  
You all cheered from the upper seats — I could see you smiling and it made me relax.

[Unknown Speaker]
It was such a proud moment.  
You’re the first Japanese artist with a PRS signature — that’s history!

[Kanami]
Thank you! I’ll keep working hard to live up to it.

[Unknown Speaker]
And then December — mostly studio work again, finishing up songs for the new anime opening in January.  
And just like that, another year is over! What a packed year, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
Everyone worked so hard.  
This year was so full — festivals, collabs, tours, releases. It’s hard to even pick one highlight.

[Unknown Speaker]
It really was *our* kind of year — so many challenges, new connections, and growth.

[Unknown Speaker]
The only thing we missed… was our Christmas gift exchange (laughs). We were too busy recording!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, suddenly it was Christmas Day and we were still in the studio!

[Unknown Speaker]
So, next year, let’s make sure to do it. Promise?

[Unknown Speaker]
Promise!

[Unknown Speaker]
All right — let’s each share a closing message for 2024.

[Kanami]
This year, I got to make many dreams come true, thanks to all of you.  
The best way I can return that gratitude is through songwriting and guitar — I’ll keep practicing hard and creating music that makes everyone smile. Please look forward to 2025!

[Akane]
2024 was a year of so many new encounters — bands like The Warning, Intervals, and Burning Brides, new friends, and so many first-time fans at festivals.  
It was a year of gratitude and connection. I hope to meet even more people in 2025!

[MISA]
This year I got to do so many things I wanted — the Hall Tour, the Zepp Tour, the collabs… it was so fulfilling.  
I’ll keep playing bass while staying healthy (and enjoying some drinks along the way). Thank you for your support!

[Saiki]
I’m just filled with gratitude — for the band, the staff, and every Master and Princess who supported us.  
It was a year of growth for all of us. I want to keep singing, keep evolving, and share even more music with everyone. Let’s keep going strong together!

[Kobato]
Like everyone said, this was a year of gratitude and growth.  
I also took on new challenges — working in English with Mikey and The Warning really changed my mindset, and made me think deeply about language and expression.  
It was a year of big steps forward.  
Next year, we’ll keep that momentum, and we have lots of plans coming — so please look forward to it, po!  
Thank you for an amazing year, and let’s make 2025 even more wonderful together, po!  
Happy New Year!

[Everyone]
Happy New Year!!
