💌 Message to Fan Club Members – MISA (6 of 10)

MISA:
Hey, it’s MISA.

Since this time’s theme is behind-the-scenes from Unseen World,
I’ll share something about the bass lines, since I was the one who made them complicated!

When we tried playing together in the studio,
the phrases were so busy and fast that we all wondered,
“When can we even take our eyes off our hands!?”

There are quite a few songs like that on this album.

Honestly, if I get drunk before a live show,
the chance of making mistakes might go up! That’s how difficult they are. (laughs)

Anyway, by the time we perform live,
I hope I’ll have practiced enough to play without staring at my hands so much.

Okay then—bye-bye!
