🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (August)

Hello, it’s MISA.

For my “Song of the Month,”
hmm… what should I pick this time?

Well, since COVID cases are increasing again,
and we still have to refrain from going out unnecessarily,
I chose a song that can help lift everyone’s spirits—
“DICE.”

I hope the day comes soon
when we can play live freely again.

Bye-bye.
