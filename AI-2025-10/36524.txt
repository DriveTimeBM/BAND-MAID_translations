## 📸 Behind the Scenes – Akane Photographing Saiki

**Akane:**  
Here? Yeah. A little higher—look toward eye level.  

Yes, that’s good. Very nice.  

Okay, look this way. Yes, great.  

Try giving me a little smile.  
*A smile?*  
A smile’s not happening.  

You look cute though. Really cute.  
Let’s try looking away from the camera.  

Perfect. That’s good. That was funny.  
(Someone laughs in the background)  
Someone had to say that!  

Nice. You’ve already switched into “model mode.”  
*Yeah, true.*  

Looking great. So cute. Amazing.  

**(Kanami, possibly in the background):**  
So cute. Amazing.  

**Akane:**  
What’s going on? Studio Alice? Studio Alice!*  
(*Studio Alice is a chain of children’s photo studios in Japan — Akane’s joking that Saiki looks like she’s in one.)*  

You’re so cute. You look like Ichigo-san!*  
(*“Ichigo-san” = literally “Miss Strawberry,” said in a playful tone.)*
