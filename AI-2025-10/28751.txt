🎥 Filming Reflections

Kanami:
This is Kanami! Today we filmed the “Gion-cho” music video.
Finally—our dream came true! We were able to film in Kyoto, something I’ve wanted to do for so long.

It was so much fun, and we got to shoot in such a beautiful place.
Please watch it many times! Under the big red moon.

MISA:
This year, we filmed in Kyoto! We’re here right now in Kyoto—it was such a fun shoot.
To all the staff and locals who helped us, thank you so much!

Akane:
So, after two days of filming as Band Maiko, it was a blast! Thank you very much.

The hardest parts were:

The bottoms of my feet hurt from wearing pokkuri (wooden maiko sandals).

Sitting in seiza for long periods—my legs went numb.

And I couldn’t go to the bathroom for over ten hours!

That’s all! Thank you!
Please watch the “Gion-cho” MV, and enjoy it!

Kobato (Speaker 1):
This is Kobato Miku. I’m so happy that we got to film a music video in Kyoto, a place I love dearly.
As Hatsuko, I was able to do many things around Miyagawa-cho, and I even got to make tea!

Please don’t judge me too harshly on my tea ceremony form—it’s all part of the charm, po!

I hope many people will watch and listen to it,
especially our Masters and Princesses in Kyoto—
and maybe even the local danna-san (gentlemen), onee-san (ladies), and okaa-san (mothers), too!

Thank you very much. It was so much fun. It’s one of my favorites!

Saiki:
Thank you very much—it was a lot of fun!
The white makeup this time was different from last year’s,
and my kimono this year was a brighter blue.

My hair was absolutely wild! (laughs)
Please watch the music video lots of times.
Oshima and I had the best time. Bye-bye!
