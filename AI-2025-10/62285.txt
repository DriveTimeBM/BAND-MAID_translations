🎥 Kanami & MISA

Kanami:
Alright, here we are again. Today, we have a guest in the audience — Kobato-san is sitting right over there watching us.
And today’s talk is between guitarist Kanamincho and bassist MISA.

Thank you for joining us.
It’s the perfect time of day — the sleepy hour.
What time is it now?

MISA:
It’s 8 o’clock.

Kanami:
Still early evening. 8 p.m., huh?
I’m sleepy already… and hungry.
Also, MISA’s already had three beers, right?

Kobato (off-camera):
That’s amazing, po!

Kanami:
Right? Saiki and MISA — alcohol is their fuel.
Three bottles of “gasoline”! Incredible.

Anyway, today’s topic—
Ah! I just surprised myself with how loud my voice was. (laughs)
Our topic is… let’s see… what were we talking about again?
Ah yes, how we first met.

MISA:
Yes, the story of when we met — the first studio day.

Kanami:
Right, right!
So, who came up with that topic?
Probably me… sorry, I forgot. (laughs)

So—when BAND-MAID was starting, Akane and I were already set to do it together,
and we were talking about who could play bass.
Akane said, “I have a friend from music school who plays bass — I’ll ask her.”

That friend was MISA.

Kobato:
You were sitting next to her?

Kanami:
Yeah, we were sitting next to each other at an izakaya (pub), drinking.
She said, “Let me think about it for a bit.”

And that made sense — because, well, it was a big shock at first.

MISA:
Yeah, definitely.

Kanami:
I mean, imagine being asked, “Hey, wanna play in a band wearing maid outfits?”
You’d go, “Wait, what? Maid outfits?”

MISA hesitated — she’d never worn anything that feminine before.
Most of her bandmates before were guys,
and in her previous band, she was the only woman.

So joining BAND-MAID was like the complete opposite of what she was used to.

MISA:
Right. My previous band had just decided to break up right around that time, too.

Kanami:
Yeah, that’s right. The timing lined up exactly.
Your disbandment was already decided, right?

MISA:
Yeah, we’d already scheduled the final live show.

Kanami:
I even went to that live, didn’t I?

MISA:
Yeah, you did.

Kobato:
That was before Saiki joined, right, po?

MISA:
Yeah, that’s right.

Kobato:
And you were wearing a tight, sexy outfit, po!

Kanami:
A catsuit?

Kobato:
Yes, a catsuit, po!

Kanami:
Wow, good memory. Yeah, MISA wore a catsuit and sunglasses —
kind of like a bass-walker-style outfit, like one of those super-cool bassist looks.
I don’t remember much of the live itself,
but I do remember seeing a photo later and thinking it totally suited her.

Kobato:
That’s too cute, po!

Kanami:
Yeah, it really was.
Now MISA’s been a maid for nine years already — crazy how fast that went.

MISA:
Nine years! Time flies.

Kobato:
Assassin Maid China, po!

Kanami:
(laughs) Yeah, the Assassin Maid.
Back then, though, MISA really looked the part of a proper maid,
and that was cute in its own way too.

We were both so skinny back then, right?

MISA:
Yeah, you could only see bones and veins in my hands. My arms were scary thin.

Kanami:
Same here!
But recently, our old staff told me, “You looked a bit fuller around Thrill era,”
and I was like, “No no, that’s just young-face plumpness!” (laughs)

But yeah, we were both so thin back then.

MISA:
I was maybe around 35 kg (~77 lbs).

Kanami:
Wow.
But now you look healthy — it really suits you.

MISA:
Yeah, I feel healthier now than before. I can eat more too.

Kanami:
That’s good. You look strong and balanced now.

Anyway, what were we talking about again?
Oh right, the first studio session!

So after MISA agreed to join BAND-MAID,
we scheduled a day to go to the studio together.
We were supposed to play for the label president that day,
so it was a really important session.

MISA:
That was the same day, right?

Kanami:
Yeah. We met early that morning at the studio to rehearse before heading to the office.

I still remember thinking, “Did she even sleep last night?”

MISA:
I didn’t. I was hungover. (laughs)

Kanami:
I knew it! You smelled like alcohol. (laughs)
But you still played perfectly!
You said, “I just practiced this song a while ago,”
and I thought, “Wait, she can still play?!”
That was honestly impressive.

So we went to the office, played in front of the president,
and they said, “Looks good — let’s go with this lineup.”

Kobato:
And that’s how BAND-MAID’s story began, po!

Kanami:
Yeah, that day was such a memorable one.
The studio was tiny — we only had one little amp.
We were practically bumping into each other while playing.

We even recorded a short video and sent it to the president.

MISA:
I didn’t realize until today that I’d been that drunk!

Kanami:
See, even now we’re learning new things about each other. (laughs)

MISA:
Yeah, it’s funny how those early days feel like another lifetime.

Kanami:
They really do. Let’s share more stories like that again next time.

MISA:
Yeah.

Kanami:
Alright, that’s all for today!

Kobato:
Bye-bye, po!
