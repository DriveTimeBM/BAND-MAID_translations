Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. It’s Saiki.

Today, I’ll be introducing Kobato.

Let’s see… I met her about eight years ago,
and from the very beginning, I thought,
“She’s a weird one. She’s a pigeon. And she’s kind of hard to deal with.”

Time has passed since then,
and although she has a kind side, she’s still a bit annoying. (laughs)

But, well… she’s also a very hardworking and passionate person.
So even though I complain about her sometimes,
I’m also thankful to have her as a bandmate.

That’s all from Saiki.
