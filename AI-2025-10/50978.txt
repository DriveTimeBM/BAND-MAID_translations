🎥 Maid’s Room – Two Mysterious Love Stories (Episode 6)

Kuruppo! Hello, Masters and Princesses, po~! 🕊️
This is the 6th episode of Kobato’s Room, po!
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, po~! 👏👏👏👏👏

Today too, Kobato and Torao will be bringing you this episode together, po!
Please take good care of us, po~!

Alright then—
Let’s get right into the 6th episode of Kobato’s Room, po!

The theme this time is:
✨ “Movies that leave you with a strange, mysterious feeling after watching.” ✨

Kobato will be talking about two movies today:
🎬 The Best Offer (2013, Italy)
and
🎬 The Good Liar (2019, USA), po!

🖼️ The Best Offer (2013, Italy)

(Japanese title: 鑑定士と顔のない依頼人 – “The Appraiser and the Client Without a Face”)

This movie tells the story of an art appraiser named Virgil
and a mysterious client named Claire, po.

It’s a 2013 Italian film.

Here’s a simple outline, po—
Virgil is a world-renowned art appraiser,
but he’s not very good with people—especially women.

He has a strange hobby:
in a hidden room, he’s collected hundreds of portraits of women.
That’s where he spends most of his time—alone,
surrounded only by these paintings, po.

One day, he receives a call from a woman named Claire,
who asks him to appraise her family mansion,
which is filled with old artworks.

But—here’s the twist—
she says she never shows her face.

At first, Virgil gets frustrated.
He comes to appraise the estate, but Claire never appears,
or suddenly cancels their meetings.

But as they continue speaking,
Virgil starts to become fascinated by her—
and eventually, he begins to fall in love, po.

You think,
“Ah, how nice—maybe this lonely old man will finally find love…”

But then—
just when you think it’s becoming a gentle love story—
something happens, po.

I can’t spoil it,
but the ending will make you go, “Wait… what just happened, po?”

It’s a mystery film, not a romance,
so even people who don’t like love stories can enjoy it, po!

The final scenes are so heartbreaking,
but the director once said in an interview that

“This film has a happy ending.”

So Kobato thought a lot about that, po.
“Wait—how is this happy?” (laughs)

Maybe it depends on how you interpret it, po.
I’ve watched it a few times,
and each time, I notice something different.

Maybe, depending on your perspective,
it is a happy ending after all, po.

Torao doesn’t seem to think so though—he’s just staring blankly, po. 🐈💤

But yes—
it’s the kind of movie that makes you think deeply about what “happiness” really means, po.

🧳 The Good Liar (2019, USA–UK)

Next, the second movie—
The Good Liar, po!

It’s a relatively recent film—
an American production released in 2019 (2020 in Japan), po!

This one’s about deception between adults, po.

The main character, Roy,
is a veteran con artist—an elderly gentleman, actually, po.

He meets a wealthy widow named Betty through a dating site,
and secretly plans to scam her out of all her money, po.

He’s done this kind of thing many times before,
but this time…
Betty is different, po.

She’s kind, elegant,
the kind of person you’d want to become in your later years—
graceful, warm, and gentle.

Roy starts off seeing her only as a target,
but the more time they spend together,
the more he finds himself genuinely drawn to her, po.

Before he knows it—
he’s in love, po. 💞

But Betty…
well, she might not be as simple as she seems, po.

From there, the story develops with twists and turns—
and at the end, there’s a huge shock, po!

Kobato was like,
“Whaaaat?! That’s what happened, po?!” 😲

It’s a movie that leaves your heart pierced in the final scene—
that kind of emotional impact, po.

It’s technically a romance,
but it also has a strong mystery and suspense element.

Not exactly a “heartwarming” story,
but definitely one that makes you reflect on life—
and on what “happiness” really means, po.

💭 Final Thoughts

Both of these films—
The Best Offer and The Good Liar—
made Kobato think deeply about human nature, po.

What does it mean to love someone?
What does it mean to be happy?

Maybe there isn’t just one answer, po.
Everyone’s happiness feels different—
and that’s what makes it so complex, and beautiful, po.

Ahh, I’ve gone and gotten all sentimental again, po. (laughs)

So, Masters and Princesses—
if you haven’t seen these two films yet,
please watch them and let Kobato know your thoughts, po!

They might help you reflect on what happiness means to you, po.

And that’s all for today, po!
This was Kobato and Torao’s Room, po~!

See you next time!
Bye-bye, kuruppo~! 🕊️💞

Torao, look at the camera! …Hey! (laughs)
