💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Kanami (3 of 4)

Kanami:
Hello, this is Kanami, the guitarist.
Today, I’ll be answering this question.

From Paul Kemi-san:
“Thank you for your wonderful guitar playing!
I’d love to hear your singing voice someday.”

Thank you very much!
Before BAND-MAID, I was actually a singer-songwriter,
so I think that’s why you said that.

These days, when Sai-chan and I perform acoustic versions,
I sometimes do the chorus vocals,
but I don’t usually sing lead since singing isn’t really my strong suit—
and besides, BAND-MAID already has two amazing vocalists,
so I’d rather leave it to them.

But if there’s ever a chance someday for you to hear me sing,
I’ll do my best!

Thank you for the question!
