🎥 Kanami & Saiki

Kanami:
Alright, here we are again—Kanamincho and Sai-chan’s talk session!
And believe it or not, this is Take 2.

We had some technical difficulties earlier… well, this one’s fault. (points off-screen)
We were chatting away, almost done, and then MISA suddenly goes,

“Uh, wait… was that even recording?”

And the camera said—

MISA (off-camera):

“There’s not enough memory.”

Kanami:
Right! That’s what it said!
And we even caught MISA cracking open a beer—“pshht!”—that was recorded!
But anyway, let’s reset and try again.

So, what were we talking about before?

Saiki:
Something about “the blue sword”?

Kanami:
The blue sword? What’s that?

Saiki:
No, no—that wasn’t it. It was “What were you doing before BAND-MAID?”

Kanami:
Ahh, right, right!
Still, “blue sword” sounds interesting, I kind of want to know about that too. (laughs)

Anyway, Sai-chan was just telling us earlier—
that when she first came to Tokyo, she got scouted by chance.

Saiki:
Yeah. When I was in junior high—second year—I came to Tokyo for my birthday,
and during that trip, I was scouted.
Sorry, it’s the second time I’m telling this story today! (laughs)

Kanami:
No worries, it’s worth hearing again.
It’s like something straight out of a manga, isn’t it?

Saiki:
I thought it was a scam! My mom and I were both like,

“There’s no way this is real—they’re going to take our money, right?”

But it turned out to be completely legit.

Kanami:
That’s amazing. You’ve had really good agencies, haven’t you?

Saiki:
Yeah, my previous one was good, and the current one too.
I’ve been lucky.

Kanami:
So that previous agency—how long were you with them?

Saiki:
That was the one that scouted me in middle school.

MISA (off-camera):
And you were scouted again for the current one, right?

Saiki:
Yep! (laughs)

Kanami:
That’s incredible—scouted twice! That’s some kind of destiny!

Saiki:
I guess so. Maybe just lucky.

Kanami:
Or maybe it’s the universe sending out “Saiki Energy.”

Saiki:
Well… back then, I was super thin, wearing short shorts and a cropped top. (laughs)

Kanami:
Yes! I remember the first time I met you—your legs were out there!
You had amazing style even back then.

Saiki:
No way, not really.

Kanami:
You’ve always worked hard.

Saiki:
Honestly, I didn’t start working out until after joining BAND-MAID.
That’s what made me start training.

Kanami:
That’s awesome. Oh, and something that surprised me when we talked earlier—
you were doing stage plays and even dance performances before BAND-MAID, right?

Saiki:
Yeah, that’s right. I did one dance job—it was during breaks between martial arts matches. (laughs)

Kanami:
What?! That’s wild!

MISA:
That’s amazing.

Kanami:
So during the time between fights, you’d go on stage and dance?

Saiki:
Yeah, like a show performance while the next match was getting ready.
There were four of us dancing.

Kanami:
Wow, I didn’t know that!

Saiki:
It was fun though.

Kanami:
You’re so talented, Sai-chan.

Saiki:
Not really—it was more like, “Try lots of things while you’re young.”
That kind of mindset.

Kanami:
Still amazing.
And you came to Tokyo when you were eighteen, right?

Saiki:
Yeah, right after graduating high school.

Kanami:
That’s so brave.
Kobato and I both said that moving to Tokyo would be terrifying.

MISA:
Yeah, Shibuya’s scary.

Kanami:
Right?! I barely went there. Even though I lived nearby, I just avoided it. (laughs)

MISA:
I think it’s because you were close enough to hear the rumors.

Saiki:
Meanwhile, for people like me and Kobato, we were separated from Tokyo by mountains and the sea.
So it felt like another world entirely.

Kanami:
Yeah, when you’re far away, Tokyo feels like this huge mythic place.

Saiki:
Exactly. And now it’s been nine years since BAND-MAID started.

Kanami:
Nine years already! Time flies.

MISA:
Wow, nine years.

Kanami:
Yeah. Time to drink to that! (laughs)

So before BAND-MAID, Sai-chan was working as a solo singer-songwriter, right?

Saiki:
Yeah, I was doing that in college.

Kanami:
Really? I didn’t know that.

Saiki:
Yeah, I was auditioning a lot—constantly sending out applications.

MISA:
You said that earlier in Take 1 too! (laughs)

Kanami:
Right, right! You said you were always applying for auditions,
filling out endless forms, getting rejected, and trying again.

Saiki:
Yeah, I’d bring my acoustic guitar to auditions,
wait in the hallway trembling with nerves,
and then they’d call, “Next!”
And I’d just go in shaking.

The judges would even tell me,

“It’s okay, don’t be so nervous!”

That’s how bad it was.

Kanami:
Aw, that’s so relatable.

Saiki:
But when I had my backing band, it felt okay—less scary.
Performing solo though… I hated it.

Kanami:
(laughs) So that’s how you realized you’re better suited for a band?

Saiki:
Exactly. Once I joined BAND-MAID, I knew I belonged here.
Being alone didn’t suit me.

Kanami:
That’s perfect then.
And didn’t you plan to have one last solo show before quitting?

Saiki:
Yeah, I called it my “final live” before starting BAND-MAID.

Kanami:
And I went to see it! (laughs)

MISA:
So cute!

Kanami:
She came straight from work just to see it!
It was adorable.

Saiki:
You even recorded it on a voice memo!

Kanami:
Yeah, but it’s gone now. It disappeared somehow.

MISA:
Aww, what a shame.

Kanami:
Yeah. Still, it was a great memory.

Honestly, I’m really glad you joined BAND-MAID.

Saiki:
Me too.

Kanami:
Alright, that’s a wrap for Take 2!
Thank you everyone for watching.

MISA:
It’s recording this time, right?

Kanami:
Yes! It’s recording! (laughs)
