## 💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Akane (2 of 4)

**Akane:**
Hello, it’s Akane!  
Welcome to the second round of the Q&A corner!  

This question is from *Manabu-san*:  
“How do you recover when you’re feeling down?”  

Actually, I got a lot of questions like this one!  

When I’m having a hard time, I try **not to spend time alone**.  
Instead, I meet up with my **bandmates or friends**,  
and when we’re laughing and having fun together, I naturally start to feel better.  

Also, I read the **letters and warm comments** from all of you, my Masters and Princesses,  
and that really lifts me up too.  

Thank you so much, always.  
Please keep supporting us from now on as well!
