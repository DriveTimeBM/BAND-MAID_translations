**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! Itâ€™s **Kobato Miku**, po!

Kobatoâ€™s recommended way to spend relaxing time at home, po,  
is to take a **long, slow bath**, po!  

Kobato brings **water and an iPad** into the bath, poâ€”  
I use it to think about **lyrics**, watch **movies or dramas**,  
or listen to **music**, po!  

I also change the **bath salts and scents** depending on my mood, po!  
Recently, I even bought a **bath pillow**,  
so I can relax comfortably, po!  

What kind of scents do you all like, po?  
Bye-bye, po!
