Kobato:
Kuruppo! It’s Kobato, po!

Today, I’ll be answering a question from Kuruko-ver-san, po!
“What’s your favorite item?”

Kobato’s favorite is Gold Ship, po!
She’s a very strong racehorse, and her name comes from a female racehorse called “Gold Ship,” po!

In the 2015 Spring Tenno Sho (Emperor’s Cup),
I was cheering for her so hard during the game, po!

Also, Sunshine Swayze—another horse—was amazing in Australia, po!
That was a legendary race, po!

She’s truly a legendary girl, po!
If you don’t know her, please check out videos on YouTube, po!

Thank you, po! Bye-bye, po!
