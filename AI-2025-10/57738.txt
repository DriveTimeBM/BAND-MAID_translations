🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (June)

Kanami:
Hello, how are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho.

Let me introduce my “Song of the Month”!

June tends to have a lot of rainy days, doesn’t it?
But I actually like rainy days,
because I’ve decided that rainy days are for café au lait.

If I remember correctly, this song was one I wrote while it was raining,
so please enjoy listening to it with a cup of café au lait.

Mirage!
