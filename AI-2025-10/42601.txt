## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Akane (4 of 10)

**Akane:**
Hello, Masters and Princesses! Itâ€™s Akane.

Today Iâ€™d like to introduce **KANAMI**!

Weâ€™ve known each other for nearly ten years now,  
and sheâ€™s actually the one who invited me to join **BAND-MAID**â€”  
a true friend and someone I owe a lot to.

Even before BAND-MAID was formed,  
she told me she wanted to start a band together someday,  
so being able to play alongside her now makes me really happy and thankful.

Sheâ€™s been supporting me for all these ten yearsâ€”  
a truly precious **best friend**.  

KANAMIâ€™s songwriting and guitar playing are absolutely amazing!  
Please keep cheering for her!  

Thatâ€™s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
