🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (December)

Hey, it’s MISA.

For this month’s song, I’ll go with “Corallium.”

Lately, I’ve been listening to this one a lot,
and every time I think, “Wow, I really nailed that sound design.”

Everyone, give it another listen too.

It’s been getting colder recently,
so please take care not to catch a cold.

Not long ago, I got some Nagano-grown yam
from our friends at Black Cloud,
and the other day, I had hotpot with Akane and Sai-chan using it.
It warmed both body and soul.

See you again!
