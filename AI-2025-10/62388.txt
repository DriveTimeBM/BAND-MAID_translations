🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (September)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

September had so many rainy days, didn’t it?
There were even times I got caught in a sudden downpour and ended up soaked on the way home.

Speaking of getting soaked—
there’s actually an MV we filmed in the middle of heavy rain.
Masters and Princesses, do you know which song that was?

That’s right—“Warning!”

It’s one of my absolute favorite music videos,
so please watch it a lot, okay?

The behind-the-scenes video from the “Warning!” Okyuji is amazing too,
so be sure to check that out as well.

That’s all from Akane.
Bye-bye!
