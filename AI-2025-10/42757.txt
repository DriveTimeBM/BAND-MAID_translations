## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Akane (8 of 10)

**Akane:**
Hello, Masters and Princesses—it’s Akane, also known as *Gorilla*! (laughs)

Today, I’m going to **guess** how the other members might introduce me.  
I already have a pretty good idea, honestly.  

They’ll probably say things like:  
“Idiot,” “Airhead,” “Big eater,” or “Her hands look like cream buns.”  
That’s definitely what they’d say, right?  

If anyone said something nice, they might call me a **kind woman**.  
If no one said that… that’d be kind of embarrassing.  

By the way, how would *you*, my Masters and Princesses, describe me?  
Tell me next time, okay?  

See you soon!
