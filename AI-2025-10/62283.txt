🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (September)

Hello, it’s MISA.

How’s everyone doing? I’m doing well.

For this month’s song, I chose “Page.”
It’s got a refreshing sound, perfect for this time of year.

It feels like autumn has arrived, but it’s still a bit hot, isn’t it?
So let’s enjoy the last of summer while we can.

This song feels nice to listen to—
whether it’s in the middle of summer or winter, it’s always refreshing.
But somehow, listening to it now feels especially good.

The photo is of a tomato curry I made recently—without canned mackerel this time.

See you!
