🎥 Kanami’s Room – Looking Back on 2016

Kanami:
How are you doing, Masters and Princesses?
This is Kanami, the guitarist. 🎸

In the previous video, I looked back at some old photos and shared memories from them.
A lot of you said that was interesting, so today I thought I’d do another one!

This time, I pulled out photos from 2016.
It’s been a while, and there’s a lot I’ve forgotten,
but I’d love to reminisce together while looking at these.

For some of you, this might be the first time hearing about these moments,
so maybe this can be like a little history lesson on BAND-MAID.
Let’s look back together.

Alright, I’ll open up my computer now.

🌷 First Time Overseas – Sakura-Con (Seattle, USA)

Here’s the first picture!
We’re all holding tulips —
this photo was taken when we went overseas for the very first time.

It was at Sakura-Con, which was our first invitation to perform abroad.
We went to Seattle, in the United States. 🇺🇸

While we were there,
we also filmed footage for the “Before Yesterday” music video!
We shot it during our stay in Seattle and later finished editing it back in Japan.

So, if you haven’t seen “Before Yesterday” yet,
please check it out — it’s one of our early memories.

💿 Major Debut – Brand New MAID

And also in 2016 —
we released our first full album, “Brand New MAID,”
and made our major label debut.

At the time, we were so happy,
but honestly, I don’t think it really sank in right away.

Still, all of us had been aiming for a major debut
even before BAND-MAID was formed,
so to achieve it together as this band…
that’s something I’m very proud of.

That same year, we went on our “Brand New MAID” release tour.
It was our first national tour — we visited so many places!

From June to around October,
we played in about 20 different cities.
We ate delicious local food everywhere we went,
and through all those travels together,
I really felt our bonds as a band deepen.

It was such an unforgettable year.

🦀 The “Crab Incident”

Next photo—crabs! 🦀
You might be wondering, “Why crabs?”
There’s a reason. (laughs)

When we first went abroad for the world tour,
our first stop was Mexico.

We were supposed to depart late at night,
and we got to the airport all excited—
only to find out there was some kind of problem.
I think it was a double booking or something like that.

Anyway, we couldn’t get on the flight.
Everyone was like, “Wait, we’re not going to Mexico today?!”

So, we decided:
“Let’s eat something delicious and take the next flight tomorrow.”

And we ended up eating… endless crab. (laughs)

Especially Sai-chan (Saiki) and Kobato-san—
they just kept eating and eating,
like they could fill buckets with crab shells.
It’s one of my favorite memories.

🇲🇽 Finally, Mexico!

Next photo—
we finally made it to Mexico!

Among all the countries we’ve been to,
Mexico is definitely one of the most powerful places.

The energy of the Masters and Princesses there is amazing!
Even before the show starts,
they’re already chanting “BAND-MAID!” outside—
sometimes more than an hour before doors open!

The first time that happened, we were like,
“Wait, what’s going on? It hasn’t even started yet!” (laughs)

That’s when I realized—
Mexico is the kind of country that loves to celebrate from the start!

The food is great, and everyone is so kind.
Mexico is truly one of my favorite countries. ❤️

🚐 Life on the Road – The Van Days

Here’s the next picture—inside a van.

During that first world tour,
we traveled across countries in a single van.

We had to fit all our equipment in it too,
so the back seat (which was a six-seater)
was shared by all six of us—including our manager!

Our feet were surrounded by instruments and cases,
so we’d sit like this (hugs knees)
and spend up to eight hours traveling between countries.

It was pretty tough,
but because we all got along so well,
it was actually a lot of fun too.

Even now, we sometimes say,
“Remember how cramped that van was?” (laughs)
It was hard, but those memories are precious.

That tour also made us realize—
there are Masters and Princesses all around the world.

Seeing people abroad who knew BAND-MAID and our songs
was so moving.

And many of them spoke Japanese,
or were studying Japanese because of us.
That still makes me teary even now.

It’s wonderful to see fans getting better at Japanese year by year.
If BAND-MAID can inspire people
to love Japanese culture and language,
that makes me truly happy.

🎸 Shimokitazawa Garden – Return Home Concert

Next photo—this one’s from Shimokitazawa Garden.

After performing in Mexico, London, Cologne, Hamburg, Paris, and Warsaw,
we returned to Japan for a special additional Okyuji (concert).

Our schedule was really tight at that time!
We had just finished our Japan national tour,
then immediately started the world tour,
and then came back home for one more show.

We wanted to do that extra concert
for the Masters and Princesses
who couldn’t get tickets to the earlier ones,
since they had sold out.

By that point, we could really feel
that our fanbase had grown.

At the very beginning,
sometimes there were only one or two people in the audience…
so realizing that we could add extra shows—
that was deeply emotional for all of us.

🇭🇰 Hong Kong Okyuji

Next photo—our Okyuji in Hong Kong.

Just about a week after the additional show in Japan,
we flew out again for Hong Kong!

It was our first time there,
so we were all nervous,
wondering what kind of place it would be.

It turned out to be very similar to Japan!
The food matched Japanese tastes perfectly—so delicious.

And the atmosphere during the live show
felt close to that of Japan too—
the fans’ way of cheering and reacting felt familiar.

🕶️ Classic Rock Awards 2016

Next photo—
this one’s from when we appeared at the Classic Rock Awards 2016.

So nostalgic!
There were so many legendary artists there.

We felt so nervous to be on the same stage as them—
it was a huge honor, but also intimidating.
I still remember how my heart was racing.

It was an incredibly inspiring day,
one where I couldn’t take my eyes off the stage even for a moment.

Someday, I hope we can stand beside artists like that
again—this time through our own strength.

💿 First Major Single Release – “YOLO”

Next, here’s a photo from when we released our major debut single, “YOLO.”

We went around visiting Tower Records and other shops for greetings and displays.
We still do those visits now,
but back then, it felt extra special.

It was such a joyful moment—
everyone at the stores treated us with so much kindness and respect.
We’re still so grateful for that.

💜 My First PRS Guitar

And here’s the last photo for today.
My hair looks a bit messy in this one, but—
this is when I bought my first PRS guitar! 💜

At the time, I was thinking a lot about the future of BAND-MAID’s sound—
what kind of tone I wanted,
and what kind of guitar could express it.

I tried out so many guitars in shops,
but PRS just felt right.

It was a gut feeling—
like, “This is the sound that will define BAND-MAID.”

The texture of the wood,
the way it fits naturally in your hands—
I was completely drawn to it.

That purple PRS became my partner from then on,
and it’s still with me today.

💐 Closing Message

So, that was a look back at BAND-MAID’s 2016.

It feels nostalgic,
but also kind of recent in some ways.
Looking at these photos brought back so many memories.

I hope you all enjoyed it too.

For the Masters and Princesses who only recently discovered BAND-MAID,
I hope this gives you a little glimpse
into the journey we’ve taken together so far.

That’s all for today’s episode of Kanami’s Room.
Thank you so much for watching! 🌸
