🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (May)

Hey, it’s MISA.

For my “Song of the Month,” I chose “Why Why Why.”

The reason is—up until partway through, it’s really busy,
with all these intricate parts going on.
But then, when it hits the chorus with that four-on-the-floor rhythm,
your head just can’t help but start nodding along—it’s so cool.

You get what I mean, right?
I love how it feels like you’ve played around freely through the A and B sections
and then finally arrive at that chorus.

The vocal vibe is great too.

If any of you can play bass, definitely try playing this one.

Bye-bye.
