All right, Masters and Princesses — Happy New Year! Yay! Welcome to 2025!

This is BAND-MAID, po! We look forward to your support again this year, po! At the end of last year, we had a fun year-end party, so today we’re here to hold our New Year’s party, po.

Thank you for joining us, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Well then, since everyone’s waiting, let’s start with a toast, po. I already said I’d drink first. Okay, cheers!

[Unknown Speaker]
Cheers! Cheers!

[Kobato]
Here’s to another great year — po! Since it’s New Year’s… Sushi!

[Kobato]
Everyone’s favorite, sushi! Let’s celebrate the new year with sushi, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Let’s dig in!

[Unknown Speaker]
What’s everyone’s favorite sushi topping?

[Unknown Speaker]
You can have my scallop, Misa-chan.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right, Misa-chan loves scallops!

[Kobato]
Do you want crab bowl instead? Sai-chan, you’ve got crab bowl, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Crab bowl!

[Unknown Speaker]
And salmon roe bowl…

[Unknown Speaker]
Salmon roe bowl, salmon roe bowl. Shrimp too.

[Unknown Speaker]
Salmon roe bowl and sushi!

[Unknown Speaker]
I wanted to say that, sorry po! Do you like rice?

[Unknown Speaker]
I love fatty tuna! Delicious. Shrimp, tuna, crab… oh, that toro looks amazing — it’s so shiny!

[Unknown Speaker]
Shiny!

[Unknown Speaker]
So glossy! All right, let’s start eating. Such a nice beginning for this gathering!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes, it begins!

[Kobato]
It’s the start of something wonderful. Even though we meet every New Year as a band, we’ve never actually filmed something like this before. What kind of New Year did everyone have?

In Kumamoto, we have a dish called “Asahi-maki” — it looks like a sunrise, with an egg yolk surrounded by fish cake. We always eat that at New Year’s.

[Unknown Speaker]
Oh, interesting! My family doesn’t have anything like that.

[Unknown Speaker]
Maybe just small differences — like the soup base for ozoni (New Year soup)? Every household has its own version. My family’s is sweet and salty with rolled omelet in it.

[Kobato]
Kumamoto ozoni is a little sweet — maybe from the soy sauce base. We use chicken stock, komatsuna greens, and mochi. Very simple but tasty.

[Unknown Speaker]
Mine had a lot of napa cabbage.

[Unknown Speaker]
Cabbage? Ours didn’t have that. We used spinach.

[Unknown Speaker]
Everyone’s ozoni is different, huh?

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, ours is clear soup, not cloudy.

[Unknown Speaker]
Misa-chan’s was so pretty, transparent!

[Unknown Speaker]
Transparent? No, it’s white!

[Unknown Speaker]
White dashi base?

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, kind of — it looks clear but it’s actually white miso.

[Unknown Speaker]
It’s amazing how local traditions vary. So, what do you all eat for New Year’s dishes (osechi)?

[Unknown Speaker]
I used to just eat kazunoko (herring roe) and black beans. I didn’t like kuri-kinton (sweet chestnut paste).

[Unknown Speaker]
Same! I only ate the chestnuts.

[Unknown Speaker]
I loved the big decorative shrimp in osechi — it was always the special treat for kids.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right, I always got that too as a kid!

[Unknown Speaker]
Okay, moving on to our 2025 plans — first, in January, our new song “Zen” is being released as the opening theme for an original anime!

[Unknown Speaker]
That was such happy news — our reaction was wild!

[Unknown Speaker]
Then we’ll be recording after the New Year break, po. A little rest is important too, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
After that, we’ve got our Liquid Room live in February — a special extra show. And that’s also Saiki’s birthday month!

[Saiki]
That’s right! My birthday! Which means I can do whatever I want, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
We’ll see what kind of setlist Saiki-sensei comes up with, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
Then March and April — the Billboard Japan acoustic dinners! Masters and Princesses can enjoy food and wine while watching the show.

[Unknown Speaker]
I went to check the venue last December. Everyone was sipping wine, so elegant.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes, I drank wine and beer too (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
It’s going to be such a lovely, intimate vibe. Can’t wait!

[Unknown Speaker]
And then May — finally, the Maid’s Day nationwide tour begins!

[Unknown Speaker]
Finally!

[Unknown Speaker]
We can visit local Masters and Princesses again — can’t wait! Every region has its own charm and delicious food.

[Unknown Speaker]
That’s one of the best parts of touring. Even the lunches are great — local specialties everywhere.

[Unknown Speaker]
We always learn so much about each area through fans too. It’s fun every time.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes, and sometimes we even make local quizzes during the shows!

[Unknown Speaker]
We’ll take ideas for those again this year, so please send them in!

[Unknown Speaker]
Then, after the tour, maybe more overseas shows. We hope to return abroad soon!

[Unknown Speaker]
If a year passes without flying overseas, it feels lonely (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
We always keep a packing list now, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Right. So much has changed in a year — and we’re grateful that more Masters and Princesses are joining us!

[Unknown Speaker]
By the time we meet again at the end of the year, it’ll have been another busy, wonderful year. If everyone enjoys this New Year’s party video, maybe we’ll do it again!

[Unknown Speaker]
We’re always meeting anyway, so let’s stay together — for our twelfth year and beyond!

[Unknown Speaker]
Let’s always be together, okay?

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes — proudly, let’s stay together forever. From today, let’s make it another happy year!
