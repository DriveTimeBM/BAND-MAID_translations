🎥 Maid’s Room – Fashion Gorilla

MISA:
Hello, it’s MISA.
Today, I’d like to welcome a special guest — a gorilla who admired my fashion from a zoo in Hyogo and has just moved to a zoo in Tokyo. Please come on in!

Akane (as “Gorilla”):
Hello, I’m a freshly arrived gorilla.
Thank you for having me today, Gorilla-san.
I don’t really know much about vintage fashion, so could you turn me into a Shimokita-style vintage gorilla using your clothes, MISA-san?

MISA:
Alright then, I’ll make you into a wonderful, stylish vintage gorilla.

Akane:
Please do! Let’s start with the first outfit.

MISA:
I picked this coordination so you can become a unique gorilla.

Akane:
Wow, that pattern is something!

MISA:
This one’s one of my favorites.

Akane:
That pattern is amazing.

MISA:
I thought pairing it with a fluffy hat and black skinny pants would make it look cool. What do you think?

Akane:
Amazing. You’d never see anything like this back at the Hyogo zoo.

MISA:
Shall we try it on then?
Okay—first outfit, the Unique Gorilla, complete!
Looks cool, right?

What do you think?

Akane:
I’ve never worn anything like this before.
And this clutch bag—the fish clutch bag adds such a unique accent.
It’s so individual… is this really okay?
Is this correct? I honestly don’t know, I’m confused.

MISA:
It’s fine.

Akane:
It looks cool? Really?

MISA:
Yeah.

Akane:
This doesn’t even feel like a clutch bag though.

MISA:
Actually, this was a fish-shaped pillow my mom gave me back when I was in middle school.

Akane:
That’s wild.

MISA:
I keep things for a long time.

Akane:
That’s amazing, MISA-san. Just having this in your house is amazing.

MISA:
Alright, now for outfit number two — the Running Gorilla.
I coordinated this one with a riders’ jacket as the image.

Akane:
That sounds fast—like a speed gorilla!

MISA:
It’s on the brighter side.

Akane:
Ah, I see. This should really boost my physical abilities.

MISA:
Hello? Yes, looks like your power’s gone up.

Akane:
Yeah, I feel the speed.

MISA:
Let’s try it on.

Akane:
Okay.

MISA:
Now, the second outfit—have you become a Running Gorilla?

Akane:
Cool!

MISA:
Think you can run?

Akane:
Yes!
I’m great at snatching bananas from boss gorillas and targets—
I feel like I could grab bananas faster than ever today!

MISA:
Alright, now the last one, outfit number three—
a long black leather coat.

Akane:
Wow, that’s shiny.

MISA:
Using this, I’ll complete the look for the Colosseum Gorilla.

Akane:
That’s cool.

MISA:
With a hat, right?

Akane:
Yeah, that’s really cool. You look strong—like you could silently take someone down. Impressive.

MISA:
Alright, time for the final look.
Let’s see how the Colosseum Gorilla turned out. Ready?

What are you throwing? What’s that?

Akane:
I’m stabbing.

MISA:
Oh—you’re stabbing! (laughs)
That’s cool.
But honestly, I’m sorry, I could never wear this myself.

So, how was it trying on all three?

Akane:
I feel like I discovered a new version of myself.
It was fun!

Clothes really change your personality.
When you coordinate outfits around a theme, your whole character can shift.
So everyone—try imagining the version of yourself you want to be when choosing outfits.

MISA:
Right?
At first it was just supposed to be “a gorilla who admired my vintage fashion,”
but before we knew it, you’d turned into a Colosseum Gorilla.

Akane:
But this really is vintage, right?

MISA:
Yeah.

Akane:
Clothes are so interesting.

Do I actually look good in this?
I really don’t know.

MISA:
Yeah, me neither. (laughs)

Akane:
Well, it’s not about whether it suits me or not—
it’s about the energy. That’s what fashion’s about.

MISA:
Exactly—energy.

Akane:
But if the theme were “clothes that suit me,” it’d be different, right?

MISA:
Yeah, I’d probably pick totally different outfits.

Akane:
Let’s do this again sometime.
Next time, maybe we can try “vintage styles that actually suit me.”

That’d be fun.

I’ll do my best to become a good female gorilla.
Please keep supporting me!

MISA:
Alright, let’s wrap it up here.

Akane:
Okay. Bye-bye!

MISA:
Shakiin! ⚡
