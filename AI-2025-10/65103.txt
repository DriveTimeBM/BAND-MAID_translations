🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (November)

Hello, it’s MISA.

For this month’s song, I’ll go with “HIDE-and-SEEK.”

I played it for the first time in a while recently,
and it felt really nostalgic.
I hope we can perform it live again someday.

When I first came up with the bass line for this song,
I remember thinking, “This is a really good one!”
Someone—maybe one of the members—
even sent it to our tour manager at the time.

If you play bass, definitely give this one a try—it’s fun to play.

The photo is of some slippers I bought at Nitori for about 200 yen.
I don’t have many photos lately.

See you!
