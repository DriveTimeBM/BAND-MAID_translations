**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! It’s Kobato, po!  

Today, I’ll be answering a question from *Nana Princess*, po!  
She asked, “I want to know about your cat, Torao!”  

Torao is a **male cat**, po. His birthday is probably around **June 7th**, po.  

He’s a **spoiled**, **mischievous**, and **timid** cat,  
but also **very curious**, po.  

His personality is actually **more like a dog than a cat**, po!  
When Kobato throws something, he **runs to fetch it right away**, po!  

He loves when I **rub his belly with my foot**, and he also loves **dried bonito treats**, po.  
He absolutely **hates vacuum cleaners** and **taking baths**, po!  

Also, when I eat **KFC chicken**, he comes begging for a bite, po—  
but I only give him a piece the size of my **pinky nail**, po!  

That’s all about Torao, po! Bye-bye, po!
