## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Kobato (9 of 10)

**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! It’s **Kobato Miku**, po!

If Kobato were to express her **goal for this year** in one kanji character,  
it would be **“挑 (to challenge)”**, po!  

In 2021, Kobato wants to **take on lots of new challenges**, po!  
Even though times are tough right now,  
I want to make this a year where I can keep **pushing forward bravely**, without losing heart, po!  

Please continue supporting me throughout this year too, po!  
That was Kobato, po!
