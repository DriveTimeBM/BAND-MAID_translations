ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ MISA (8 of 10)

MISA:
Hey there! Itâ€™s MISA.

So, this timeâ€™s theme is my goal for this year.

If I were to express it in one kanji character,
it would be éŸ³ (sound/music).

I chose it because I want to keep creating music and continue writing songs.

Thatâ€™s the goal I want to live by this year.

Since Iâ€™ll probably still be spending a lot of time at home,
I also want to cook more often and get better at it!

Please keep supporting me again this year!

Bye-bye!
