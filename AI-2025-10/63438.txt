🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (October)

Hello, it’s MISA.

Since it’s my birthday month,
I decided to let the other members choose this time.

They picked “The Dragon Cries.”
It’s got such a cool, groovy bass line.

It already feels kind of nostalgic somehow.
Everyone, please give it a listen.

The photo is of a record player I recently got—
I think I might be getting hooked on vinyl.

See you!
