Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. It’s Saiki.

I’ll be answering another question today.

This one is from Gen’en-san:
“I think the way you play piano is really wonderful.
Do you have any plans to post more piano performance videos in the future?”

At the moment, no—not right now.
But please look forward to it!

I actually started seriously practicing piano after our tours were put on hold.
The reason I started was simply because I wanted to level up my skills.

Please look forward to what’s next!
