## 💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Akane (1 of 4)

**Akane:**
Hello, Masters and Princesses! It’s Akane.

This time, I’ll be answering questions from everyone—yay!

The first question is from *Shin-chan*:  
“What BAND-MAID songs are easy for beginner drummers to play?  
I’d prefer ones that don’t use a twin pedal.”

Good question!  
If you look at songs from our first album, **MAID IN JAPAN**,  
those don’t use a twin pedal, so I think they’re easier to start with.  

From more recent Okyuji setlist regulars, I recommend:  
**“FREEDOM,” “Don’t You Tell Me,”** and **“Choose Me.”**  

Rather than trying to copy everything exactly,  
feel free to adjust the parts to fit what you can play.  
As long as you’re having fun, that’s totally fine!  

Keep drumming—fight on!  

That’s all for now. This was Akane!
