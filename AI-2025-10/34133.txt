Kobato:
I want Min-chan to sing for me, po!

Kanami:
Who’s going to sing?

Kobato:
Everyone together, po! Let’s all sing together!

Everyone, are you ready? We’re about to go into battle, po!
We’ll all sing the Happy Birthday song together, po!

Here we go—ready, po!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 times, po!

Kanami:
Six times?

Kobato:
It’s the sixth 810th birthday, po!
If this is your first time, you might be confused—
but Sai-chan once told me, “Since your name starts with ‘8,’ you’re 810 years old!”
And ever since then, Kobato has celebrated being 810 again and again and again, po!

So this is the sixth 810th birthday, po!

There have been so many! I’m so happy, po!

Thank you so much, everyone, po!
