🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (January 2022)

Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanami.

For this month’s song, I chose “endless Story.”

I picked it with the wish that this year will finally be one
where we can sing together—raising our voices side by side again.

The photo I’m sharing is of mochi I had left over from New Year’s,
which I ate with butter, soy sauce, and seaweed—so good!

How do you like to eat your mochi?

See you next time!
