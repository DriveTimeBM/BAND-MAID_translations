ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Saiki (10 of 10)

Saiki:
Hello, good afternoon, good evening, Masters and Princesses. Itâ€™s Saiki.
How are you doing?

Hereâ€™s a little behind-the-scenes story from Maid Day.

Kobatoâ€”well, Kuruppo-sanâ€”performed as the opening act,
and she said that all the members, including me, were watching.

Butâ€¦ I actually didnâ€™t get to see it. (laughs)
Sorry about that.

Anyway, great job to everyone involvedâ€”it was such an exciting show!
