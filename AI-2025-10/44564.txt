## 💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Kanami (2 of 4)

**Kanami:**
Hello, it’s Kanami, the guitarist. I’ll be answering another question today!

This one is from *Group Maid in Nagoya-san*:
“I’d like to know which guitarists or bands influenced you, besides Santana.  
Also, where do your ideas for guitar riffs and sounds come from?”

There are so many guitarists and bands that have influenced me,  
I don’t think I could possibly name them all in 30 seconds!  

As for ideas—what I value most are **input and output**.  
I always listen to various artists, analyzing them in my own way,  
and when it comes to riffs, I just become a **riff machine**—constantly creating them.  

I’ll continue to keep improving, so please keep supporting me!  
Thank you very much for the question!
