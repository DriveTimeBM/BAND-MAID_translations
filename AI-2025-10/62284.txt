🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (September)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

How are you all doing?

For this month’s “Song of the Month,” I chose “Decided by Myself.”

When the air starts to change and you can really feel the shift of the seasons,
I always find that the intro to this song starts playing in my head.

Please give it a listen, Masters.

This was Saiki. Bye-bye.
