🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (June)

Kobato’s “Song of the Month” for June is “Matchless Gum,” po!

Why this song, you ask, po?
Well, it’s because June is Torao’s birthday, po!

Torao is such a spoiled kitty—if I don’t play with him,
he meows non-stop, po.
And sometimes, maybe because he feels lonely,
he’ll meow at night too and wake me up, po.

So this song is just like that—“I can’t sleep~”, po!

But he’s so cute that I forgive him, po.
Just like the song says—I’m crazy about you, po!

Bye-bye, po~!
