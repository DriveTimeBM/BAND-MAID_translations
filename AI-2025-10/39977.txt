🎥 Kanami’s Room – Hand-Drip Coffee Time

Kanami:
How are you all doing?
This is Kanami. ☕

Today, I’d like to make some coffee with a hand-drip.
Alright, let’s get started.

I already poured a little hot water just now,
but first, you pour the water slowly into the center —
like letting drops fall gently into the coffee grounds.

Try not to let the hot water touch the outer edges too much.
Now, let’s let it bloom for about 30 seconds.

...Okay, it’s bloomed.

After that, I’ll start pouring the water again —
drawing a circle, like the hands of a clock moving around to “7 o’clock.”

The rhythm is important.
At first, let the coffee drip slowly,
and enjoy the aroma as it rises.

Ah… it smells so nice. Really nice.

If the water hits the edges directly,
it can make the flavor taste rough,
so it’s best to avoid pouring on the filter itself.

It’s actually really hard to pour water and talk while filming at the same time!
I’m sure this part will probably be fast-forwarded. (laughs)

Today’s coffee beans are Mandheling, from Indonesia.

For one cup of coffee, the ideal brewing time is about three minutes.
Of course, it depends on how fast the coffee drips,
but roughly three minutes per cup is the guideline I use.

When about a minute and a half has passed,
and the cup is one-third to half full,
I stop the slow dripping and pour more freely —
a nice, steady stream.

It’s like I’m drawing a “No, no, no” shape. (laughs)

These beans were aged for about two weeks,
so the flavor should be very rich and full-bodied.
Since they’re dark roast, the caffeine content is a bit lower.

The teacup I’m using today is from a brand called Mechtut.
It’s one of my favorites.

I usually make coffee in the morning
or during snack time in the afternoon.

It’s done! ☕

Let’s have a taste.

Ahh… it’s delicious.

See you next time.

💡 Fan Notes

Tone: Kanami speaks gently, like she’s inviting fans into her quiet world — calm, precise, and mindful.

Mandheling (マンデリン): A well-known Indonesian coffee bean variety with a deep, earthy taste.

Blooming (蒸らす): The 30-second step allows gases to escape for better flavor — Kanami explains this naturally, showing her attention to detail.

“No, no, no” part: She jokes about the shape her pouring makes — “ノーを書くの” — which sounds like she’s “writing ‘no’ in water.” A very Kanami kind of wordplay.

Mechtut cup: Likely a delicate European-style tea or porcelain brand — she clearly treasures her utensils.
