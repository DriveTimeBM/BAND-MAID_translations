🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (June)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

It’s June—rainy season, huh?
I used to dislike going out during the humid, gloomy rainy days,
but recently, I bought matching rain boots with Kanami,
and now, even on days when I’d normally feel down,
just wearing those matching boots makes me excited and brightens my mood.

So, the song I picked for this month is one that makes you feel cheerful—
“Catharsis.”

Let’s get through the rainy season together!
