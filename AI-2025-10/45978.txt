🎥 Maid’s Room – Special Field AF1

Saiki:
Masters, hello. It’s Saiki.

This time, it’s that time again — yes, more sneakers.

Today’s sneakers come in a really big box.
Here—see how big it is?

I kept this box in my shoe closet,
and one day an umbrella fell on it and poked a hole,
and I’m still upset about it.
It’s been years.

Inside this big box is the pair I’m introducing today —
Air Force 1s.

Here they are.

When I posted a photo of these on Instagram,
people commented things like,

“What are those?”
“Where can I buy them?”
and that made me really happy.

The name of this pair is:
Nike Women’s Special Field Air Force 1 High.

It’s based on the Air Force 1 silhouette,
but the Special Field version—
that’s this one.

They have kind of a military style,
almost like combat boots,
with thick, rope-like laces,
and that rugged look is one of their most distinctive features.

When they were released,
I think the colors included khaki, maybe brown,
and white too.
There was also orange, which was cute—
but since I like boots,
I wanted something that was a sneaker but still boot-like,
something casual and a bit masculine,
so I chose the black ones.

If you look closely at the laces,
you can see the AF1 graphic printed on them.

The outsole is a gum rubber sole,
and it’s known for being biodegradable—
well, relatively. (laughs)

But it looks great.

I wear these pretty often,
so they’re still in good condition,
but if you leave them in storage too long,
the gum sole turns a bit white
and starts flaking,
which is… really heartbreaking.

So I’m doing my best to take care of them.

One time,
since the heel part is leather,
I polished it with some leather conditioner,
and I actually liked the way it looked afterward—
now it’s got this kind of soft sheen,
like a nice worn-in texture.

This thick, rope-like strap also came in a different color,
and when I swapped it out,
it gave the shoes a much cuter look.

You can lace them all the way up to the top,
which looks nice,
but some people wear them loose from the bottom,
or even without laces—
there are so many ways to style them.

So if you look them up online and they’re still around,
Masters, maybe you should try getting a pair too.

Alright, that was Saichan’s recommended sneakers.

See you next time.
Bye-bye. 👋
