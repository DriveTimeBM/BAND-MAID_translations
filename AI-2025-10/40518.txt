🩵 World Domination: Shinka Release Talk

Kobato:
So, yesterday we released our very first solo video work, World Domination Tour: Shinka, po!

All:
Yaaay!

Kobato:
Please make sure to watch it, everyone, po!

Kanami:
Yes, yes!

Kobato:
Thank you, po!
And today, we also joined YouTube Music Week, hosted by YouTube itself, po!

It was so much fun! Did everyone enjoy it, po?
We all watched together while chatting live in the comments, po!

Akane:
Yeah, we did, po!

Kobato:
I was typing comments the whole time, but no one really replied to me, so I sulked a bit, po!

Saiki:
(laughs) You sulked?

Kobato:
Yes, po! Staff even said I looked like I had muscles in my head, po!
Anyway, what did you all think, po? The chat was moving so fast—like zoom!—you could barely read it!

MISA:
Yeah, it was wild. Even when you commented, it disappeared instantly.

Kobato:
Exactly! But Sai-chan even called Mincho by name in the chat, po!

Kanami:
Yeah, I was like, “Wait—did she just call me Kanami?!”

Kobato:
Right, po! I even messaged her, “Was that really you?” (laughs)
Anyway, I hope everyone watching enjoyed it too, po! Thank you, po!

💿 Favorite Moments from Shinka

Kobato:
Now, let’s do something special, po!
We’re each going to share our favorite scenes from the Shinka concert video, po!

We each picked one scene to recommend to our Masters and Princesses, po!

Alright—Saiki, please start us off, po!

Saiki:
Okay. I chose a scene that really made my heart flutter — from Screaming.
There’s this moment where I make eye contact with the Masters and Princesses,
and then glance over to Kobato.
Seeing that flow of connection again on video gave me chills — in a good way.
It made me realize, “Ah, this is the energy we share.”

Kobato:
That’s so true, po! From the stage, you can’t see yourself like that, po.

Saiki:
Right. So I want everyone to notice that when watching.

Kobato:
Wonderful, po!

Kobato:
Okay, next up—my pick, po!
If I had to give it a title, it would be “Kobato: The Future AI Maid,” po!

Let’s take a look, po!

(clip plays: Kobato doing her famous “Moe Moe Kyun!” call)

Akane:
You were so loud!

Kobato:
Hey! Even louder than the AI voice, po! (laughs)
I swear, the Moe Moe Kyun! response from the audience was louder than when I said it, po!

MISA:
You were glowing during that part.

Kobato:
See? Even MISA says so, po! It was pure joy—
that was my favorite scene, po!

Kanami:
My pick was Wonderland.
For Saiki fans, it’s an absolutely heart-melting performance.
Her powerful vocals mixed with those soft smiles…
it’s irresistible!

Kobato:
See? Even Sai-chan’s wink moment looked like one, po!

Saiki:
I didn’t wink!

Kobato:
You totally did, po! (laughs)

MISA:
Mine is from Play.
There’s a moment right at the start where I kind of “awaken,”
and my expression suddenly changes.
After that point though… I have no memory of what happened.

All:
WHAT?! (laughs)

Kobato:
You mean you don’t remember?!

MISA:
Nope. I blacked out from excitement.

Kobato:
(laughs) That’s wild, po! So everyone,
when you watch that scene, just remember—
from here on out, MISA has no memory, po!

Akane:
For me, I picked the part right before the last chorus of Play,
where Sai-chan’s shout leads into Kobato’s screaming voice.
That moment gives me goosebumps every time.

Kobato:
Oh no… that face, po! (laughs)
The others even made LINE stickers from that screenshot!

Saiki:
We had to! It was too good!

Kobato:
That’s bullying, po! (laughs)
But fine—it’s now officially called “Laser Ramon Kobato,” po!
Our staff even edited that moment especially for us,
so thank you, BAND-MAID staff, for your rapid response, po!

🧡 Maid Day (May 10th) Announcement

Kobato:
Alright! Before we wrap up—
we have an announcement, po!

Quiz time! What is May 10th?

Akane:
It’s Maid Day!

Kobato:
Correct, po! Because May (5) and 10 (do) make Meido (Maid), po!

Originally, we had booked a live house for Maid Day over a year ago,
but due to the current situation in the world,
we can’t hold an in-person Okyuji (live performance).

All:
Aww…

Kobato:
However! Instead, we’ll hold our first-ever online Okyuji, po!
We want to bring energy and smiles to all Masters and Princesses staying safe at home.
So we’ll be streaming live on YouTube!

Please look forward to it, po!

And—of course—we’ll also be releasing new Maid Day goods online, po!

Saiki:
Since it’s our first online performance,
we’ll make it something special that only we could do this way.
We’ll discuss ideas with the whole BAND-MAID team
and prepare something you can really enjoy—so please look forward to it.

Kobato:
Thank you, Sai-chan, po!
Everyone, please stay tuned for Maid Day 2020’s online Okyuji,
and keep your hearts open for the energy of BAND-MAID, po!

All:
See you at the show—bye-bye, po! 🕊️
