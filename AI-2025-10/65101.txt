🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (November)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

This month’s song that fits my mood is “Corallium.”

“Corallium” is the first song for which I wrote all the lyrics myself,
and I wonder—have you all been listening to it a lot?

I chose it because I’d really love for everyone
to keep listening to it this month too.

It’s a song that perfectly suits the coming cold season.

That’s all—goodbye.
