💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Saiki (1 of 4)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. It’s Saiki.

Today, I’ll be answering another question we received!

The question is:
“If the five members of BAND-MAID were to do Sailor Moon cosplay,
which character would each of you be?”

According to Saiki’s personal opinion—

Kobato would be Sailor Chibi Moon,
MISA-chan would be Sailor Pluto,
A-chan would be Sailor Jupiter,
Kanami-chan would be Sailor Neptune,
and I would be Sailor Mars.

That’s what I think.
