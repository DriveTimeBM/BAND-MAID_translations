🎬 BAND-MAID – “Rinne” MV: Behind the Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
How are the flowers arranged for this shot?

[Unknown speaker]:
Ah, it started—the switch flipped on.

[Unknown speaker]:
Her eyes are opening!

[Unknown speaker]:
Good morning! My eyes are finally opening up now. I feel awake—like my vision just reset. Amazing. But three people still haven’t joined in yet.

Since the senpai hasn’t started either, it’s easy to get distracted.

[Unknown speaker]:
Whoa, that’s amazing.

[Unknown speaker]:
So senpai-style. Once she’s in the zone, it’s full-on teacher mode.

[Unknown speaker]:
Let’s go “senpai-style!”

[Unknown speaker]:
Senpai’s eyes open wide! Mine too—see? Nice!

That first touch—it’s different, isn’t it? You can tell from the first touch! So good.

[Unknown speaker]:
Why am I so… like this? Ah, everyone’s back now. Alright—we can do this!

[Unknown speaker]:
Lately, I just really want sweets. I want sweets so bad.

[Unknown speaker]:
Same. Really want them.

[Unknown speaker]:
Same here! That’s a great voice, by the way.

[Unknown speaker]:
We’ve got it—the song is ready! The “I want sweets” song is done!

[Unknown speaker]:
Here it comes!

[Unknown speaker]:
Yay!

[Unknown speaker]:
Finally, we can eat!

🎸 On the Intense Performance Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
How were the performance scenes?
This might be the most intense one we’ve ever filmed, right?

Musically too—it’s wild.
It’s probably the first time you’ve ever used the double kick pedal this much for a music video, isn’t it?

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah, that’s right—definitely the most. (laughs)

[Unknown speaker]:
Look forward to it! Look forward to it! Or should we say “please look forward to it,” Kanami-san?

[Unknown speaker]:
Kanami-san and MISA-san’s filming is done!

[Unknown speaker]:
Great work, everyone!

🎥 Reflections on Filming

[Unknown speaker]:
So, what kind of music video did it turn out to be?

[Unknown speaker]:
Well, Mincho-chan… this was our first time shooting on 8mm film!

Because of that, we still don’t quite know how the footage will look until it’s developed—but it should turn out really cool!

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah, the atmosphere was amazing—so much character.

[Unknown speaker]:
The lighting was fantastic—it really brought out everyone’s features.

[Unknown speaker]:
The mood and the tone came out so well.

[Unknown speaker]:
The performance scenes were powerful! Definitely check them out when you watch the finished MV.

[Unknown speaker]:
It was a really good day today. Truly. Bye-bye!

🌀 Closing Thoughts

[Saiki]:
Thank you very much!
Since “Rinne” was filmed on 8mm film, something I personally had always wanted to do,
I’m really looking forward to seeing the finished product—and I hope everyone else will too.
Please watch it many times!

[Kobato]:
Bye-bye!

This was our first time shooting properly in a place that looked like a ruin or abandoned building.
People often say Kobato is the type that “attracts spirits,”
so everyone told me to bring something for purification—so I did!

I came fully prepared, and I think the video turned out to be both cleansed and cool.
I hope many Masters and Princesses will watch it.

Kobato was headbanging so hard that I’m honestly worried about her neck for tomorrow’s filming.
That’s the kind of energy this shoot had—please enjoy it!
