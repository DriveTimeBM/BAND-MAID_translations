## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Kanami (5 of 10)

**Kanami:**
Hello, itâ€™s Kanami on guitar.

Today Iâ€™d like to introduce **MISA**!  

On stage, she drinks whiskey and has this super cool, mysterious vibe,  
but off stage, she can be surprisingly playful.  
When sheâ€™s had a bit to drink, she becomes really sweet and affectionateâ€”so cute!  

Whenever I send her a song, she always sends her bass part back right away.  
Sheâ€™s incredibly fast and efficientâ€”my **perfect songwriting partner**.  

Thatâ€™s all for today!
