🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (December)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

December is my birthday month!
This year again, everyone celebrated with me,
and I was able to have such a happy birthday.

Masters, Princesses—thank you so much
for all your warm messages and pictures.
I’m really touched and grateful.

For this month’s song,
I chose “about Us” to express my gratitude.

Thank you, everyone, as always.
Please keep supporting us from here on out too.

The photo I’m sharing is of the cake
the members gave me to celebrate.
Thank you!
