🎥 Maid’s Room – Stranger Things Sneakers

Saiki:
It’s Nike.

Masters, how are you doing?

Alright, for this episode, I’ll be introducing another pair of sneakers.
Once again, they’re from Nike.

These sneakers are part of Nike’s collaboration with the Netflix sci-fi drama series Stranger Things.
I’ll be showing the third release in that collaboration.

There were first and second drops before,
and this is the third, designed with the concept of the Starcourt Mall —
the main setting of Stranger Things Season 3.

Okay, let’s open it.
Here we go.

When you open it up, it even says “Nike Stranger Things.”
And here—inside the box lid—it says “Starcourt Mall.”

Amazing, right?
It even has a map or blueprint of the mall printed inside!
Look at this—so detailed!

There were three models released in this third collaboration:
the Tailwind, Blazer, and Cortez.

The pair I managed to get was the Cortez.

Why the Cortez?
Well—these shoes were super popular in both Japan and the U.S.
They sold out instantly at release.

I couldn’t get them in Japan,
but during last year’s U.S. tour,
when we were in New York—
before our call time at the live house,
I had a little free time, so I thought,
“I’ve gotta go sneaker-hunting!”

And then—I found them!
They had one left in my size.
So I got them!
So happy.

Now, what’s unique about these third-release models is the overlay material.
If you lightly rub it with sandpaper or a knife,
the underlayer appears,
revealing a completely different design underneath.

It really brings out your creative side, doesn’t it?
That’s so Stranger Things-like.

Let’s take a look at the insole—it’s super cute.
Here—on the right foot,
it says “Suzie, do you copy?” —
which is actually the title of Episode 1 of Season 3!
How detailed is that?!

By the way, I still haven’t customized mine yet—
I can’t bring myself to do it.
You can tell just by looking, right?
It’s too precious, I can’t do it.

But a person from our record label—
they’re also a sneaker fan—
got the Blazer model,
and they actually customized theirs.

Nike didn’t officially recommend it,
but they even used a lighter and fire to burn the material slightly.
It turned out really cool.

I want to do the same with my cute Cortez,
but my “don’t-ruin-it” instinct is too strong,
so I haven’t yet.

The sole is simple,
but if you peel off the Nike logo with a knife,
the Stranger Things logo appears underneath.

It showed up clearly on the Blazer model,
and it’s said to appear on the Cortez and Tailwind too.

These sneakers even came with pins—
so cute!
And they have Starcourt Mall paint splatter patterns on them—adorable.

They also came with extra black shoelaces,
so changing the laces gives it another nice look.

That’s about it.

That was my introduction of these Nike Stranger Things sneakers.

See you next time.
Bye-bye. 👋
