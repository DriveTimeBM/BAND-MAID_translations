🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (December)

Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho.

This year really flew by, didn’t it?
Masters and Princesses, how will you be spending your New Year’s holidays?

Next year, I want to perform Okyuji in front of all of you again.
I also want to travel overseas and continue our mission of world domination!

With those wishes in mind, my “Song of the Month” is “DOMINATION.”

May wonderful days come to all Masters and Princesses in the coming year.

That’s all from Kanamincho—
have a Happy New Year!
