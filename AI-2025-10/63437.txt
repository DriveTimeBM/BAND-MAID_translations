🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (October)

Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho.

This month, we’re celebrating the birthdays of MISA and Kobato—congratulations! 🎉

Lately, it’s been hard for all of us members to gather like we used to,
but I’m hoping the day will come soon when we can go out together again—
maybe have some drinks at an izakaya and celebrate while getting a little tipsy.

For this month, I selected a song that I’d love to play if we were having an Okyuji right now:
“Clang.”
