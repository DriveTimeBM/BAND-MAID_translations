## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Kanami (3 of 10)

**Kanami:**
Hello, itâ€™s Kanami on guitar.

I heard that everyone will be introducing me today, and honestly, Iâ€™m nervous!  
What if they all say Iâ€™m weird or something? (laughs)  

But since everyoneâ€™s so kind, Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll give me a really nice introduction.  

By the way, I truly love every one of my bandmates.  
Theyâ€™re all so precious to me.  

Thatâ€™s all from **Kanamincho**!
