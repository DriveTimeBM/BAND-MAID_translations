Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. It’s Saiki.

The question I got this time is:
“How do you usually spend your time on airplanes?”

For BAND-MAID, flights are all about getting as much sleep as possible.
So I always make sure to have items that help me sleep comfortably.

If I can’t fall asleep, I just watch movies instead.

As for seats—there’s no set arrangement,
but for some reason, I often end up by the window, which I’m grateful for.
