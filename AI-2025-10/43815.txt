## 💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Kanami (1 of 4)

**Kanami:**
Hello, it’s Kanami, the guitarist.
Today, I’ll be answering a question we received!

This one is from *Marshan-san*:
“If you were to write a song for someone other than BAND-MAID, who would you want to write for?”

Hmm… no one specific comes to mind right away,
but rather than someone I don’t know at all,
I’d want to write for an **artist I truly like and respect**.

Once I have a little more time and freedom,
I’d definitely love to **take on that kind of challenge** someday.

Thank you very much for the question!
