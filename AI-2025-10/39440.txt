Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. Itâ€™s Saiki.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been spending time at home working on personal growth.

Iâ€™ve always loved physical training, so Iâ€™ve kept that up,
but Iâ€™ve also been practicing with the keyboard to improve my pitch and musical sense
so that I can become an even better singer.

Itâ€™s a tough time right now, but weâ€™ve got to push through it together.

Letâ€™s do our best so that we can see each other again
at Okyuji with peace of mind.

See you next time.
