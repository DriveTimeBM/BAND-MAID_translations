## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – MISA (9 of 10)

**MISA:**
Hey, it’s MISA.

Since this time’s theme is a behind-the-scenes story from **Maid Day (May 10th)**,  
I’ll share one from that day.  

Honestly, when I first thought about it, nothing really stood out—  
but if I had to pick something, it would be how I **struggled to get into “Assassin Mode”** before the show started.  

That morning, I even said, “I want to meet the version of MISA who can’t switch into MISA mode yet.” (laughs)  

But once the **intro SE** started and I took a small sip of **alcohol**,  
my switch just **suddenly flipped on**, and I was ready to go.  

I’d forgotten, but that’s how I always end up starting things—  
and remembering that made me realize again how **MISA always saves MISA** in the end.  

That’s all. Bye-bye.
