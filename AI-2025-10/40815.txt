🎥 Maid’s Room – Kobato’s Movie Recommendations #2

Kuruppo! It’s Kobato Miku, po! 🕊️✨

This is the second episode of Maid’s Room, po!
Once again, it’s Kobato, Torao, one maid, and one bird bringing this episode to you, po!

Now then, did everyone see the first Shall We Dance? episode, po?
For today’s second episode, I’m going to do something special, po!
I’ll be introducing two movies this time!

Tora-chan! Tora-chan! Hey—Kobato’s not food, po!
Ow! That hurts, po! (laughs)

Alright, let’s move on to the movie introductions, po!
Ta-dah! Kobato’s Room, Part 2!

The two films I’ll be recommending this time are
🎬 Burlesque and 🎬 The Devil Wears Prada, po!

💃 Burlesque (2010)

First up is Burlesque!
It’s an American film released in 2010, starring none other than Christina Aguilera, po!

Aguilera-sama’s singing voice is absolutely stunning, po!

The story follows a young woman who leaves her small hometown for Los Angeles,
and watching her transformation—from a country girl to a radiant star shining on stage—
is just incredible, po!

The role of Tess, the club owner and mentor to the main character,
is played by Cher-sama, and her singing is magnificent, po!

Really, the Burlesque soundtrack is so good
that it could stand on its own as a full album, po!
Kobato even has it downloaded on her phone,
and still listens to it regularly, po!

It’s packed with wonderful songs and performances.
Please, everyone—make sure to watch Burlesque, po!

(Munching sound) “Oops—chewing again, po! Delicious, po!” (laughs)

👠 The Devil Wears Prada (2006)

Next up—The Devil Wears Prada, po!

You all know this one, right?
It’s a 2006 American film starring the beautiful Anne Hathaway, po!

Even at the beginning of the movie,
you can’t completely hide her natural beauty, po~!

She plays a young aspiring journalist
who accidentally lands a job in the fashion industry—
an industry she’d never been interested in before—
and ends up working under a boss who’s… well, kind of a devil! 👹

That boss, Miranda, is played by Meryl Streep,
and her acting is absolutely brilliant, po!

She’s so intimidating that Kobato would probably run away crying, po! (laughs)
But as the story goes on,
you begin to see Miranda’s human side—her depth, strength, and vulnerability.
It’s such a moving film, po!

Of course, both Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep are amazing,
but Kobato’s favorite character is Nigel,
played by Stanley Tucci, po!

Nigel has such a unique presence—
he gives advice and guidance to Anne’s character, Andrea,
with warmth and humor,
and his performance just shines, po!

Please pay attention to Nigel’s character when you watch the movie, po!
He’s really something special.

And of course, the fashion in this film is absolutely stunning, po!
You’ll catch yourself thinking, “Prada really is cool, po~!”

The clothes, the style, the transformation—it’s all beautiful.
This movie really lets you rediscover how amazing fashion can be, po!

Please watch it and tell me what you think, po!
I’ll be waiting for your impressions, po! 💌

🎵 Next Episode – Kobato’s Quiz!

Alright, next time—
the movie I’ll be introducing has already been decided, po!

Here’s a quiz for you!

The next movie I’ll talk about
is actually a film that inspired lyrics in one of BAND-MAID’s songs, po!

So! The question is:
Which BAND-MAID song was inspired by that movie, po?

Think about it, po~
and look forward to the next episode, po!

This was Kobato and Torao, po!
Bye-bye, kuruppo! 🕊️💞
