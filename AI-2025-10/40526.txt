**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! Itâ€™s **Kobato Miku**, po!  

This time, Kobato will be introducing **Kanamincho**, po!  

Mincho doesnâ€™t realize it herself, but sheâ€™s a bit of a **mystery girl**, po!  
During Okyuji, she sometimes **awakens** out of nowhere and surprises everyone, po!  

Sheâ€™s usually all soft and fluffy, but when itâ€™s time for rehearsal or a live show,  
**serious Mincho** appears and keeps everything running smoothly, po!  
Thanks to her, our schedule always goes perfectly, po!  

She loves **coffee**, and we often go for coffee together, po!  
She also really loves **the color green** and **Coji-Coji**, po!  

Kobato loves that adorable Mincho very much, po!  
Thatâ€™s all for nowâ€”bye-bye, po!
