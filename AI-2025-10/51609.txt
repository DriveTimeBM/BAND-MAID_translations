## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Akane (10 of 10)

**Akane:**
Hello, it’s Akane.

If I were to express my goal for this year in **one kanji character**, it would be **“進 (to advance)”**.  

Both as an individual and as a band, I want to **keep progressing, evolving, and moving forward** every single day.  
That strong determination is why I chose the character “進.”  

Let’s all face forward together, never stop walking, and keep stepping ahead one by one—with hope in our hearts.  

Let’s do our best! Ready? Go!  

That’s all from Akane. Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
