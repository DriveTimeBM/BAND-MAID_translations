🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (August)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.
How are you, OMEISYUSAMA?

The song I chose that fits my mood this month is “Summer Drive.”

When you think of summer, it’s definitely this song!
So for August, I picked a nostalgic one.

Let’s all stay energetic and not lose to the scorching sunshine!

Listening to “Summer Drive” makes me want to play at a summer festival again.
I’m really looking forward to the day when we can shout and enjoy Okyuji together.

That’s all from Akane.
Bye-bye!
