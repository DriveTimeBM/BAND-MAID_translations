ðŸ’¬ Voice Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Kobato (3 of 4)

Kobato:
Kuruppo! Itâ€™s Kobato, po!

This time, Iâ€™ll be answering a question from Hanami-sama, po!
You asked me to talk about my Zemaitis V, po!

The Zema V is the Zemaitis V-shaped guitar that Kobato unveiled during the final show of our previous tour, po!
Itâ€™s also called the ZV, po!

And guess whatâ€”Kobato was the first person in Japan to ever play this ZV on stage, po!
That made me so happy, po!

It keeps that cool, classic Zemaitis sound,
but since the body is a bit smaller, it suits female players really well, po!

Itâ€™s such an incredibly rock-style guitar,
the kind that makes you just want to play hard and fast, po!

Thatâ€™s all for nowâ€”bye-bye, po!
