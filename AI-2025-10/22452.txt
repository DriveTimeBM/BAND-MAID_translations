Kanami:
Hello, OMEISYUSAMA! It’s Kanami Mincho.

Recently, we’ve been traveling to lots of different countries—
Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore, and Malaysia!

Everywhere we went, the Masters and Princesses were so happy to see us,
and that made me incredibly happy too.

And the food in every country was so delicious!

We’ve been posting photos of our adventures on Instagram,
so please check them out when you have time!

Also, the music video for “Start Over” was recently uploaded—have you seen it yet?

That song was written with the idea that everyone could sing it together,
so I really hope you’ll memorize the melody—
I’ll be practicing too!
And let’s all sing it together at an Okyuji!

That’s all from Kanamincho. Thank you so much!
