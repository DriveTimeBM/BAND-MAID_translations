🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (February 2022)

Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanami.

February is Sai-chan’s birthday month, isn’t it?

Thank you, Saiki, for being born,
and thank you for doing this band together with us.

Lately, she’s even been writing lyrics—
so this month, let’s all listen to one of Saiki-sensei’s lyrical works!

So, my “Song of the Month” is “Corallium.”
