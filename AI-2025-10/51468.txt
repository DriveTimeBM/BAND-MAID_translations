🎬 BAND-MAID – “Manners” MV: Behind the Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
Alright, ready? Let’s begin!

[Unknown speaker]:
No, no, no—that’s ridiculous!

[Unknown speaker]:
Ooh, that’s cold! Are you okay? Want me to move it a bit to the right?
Isn’t that impossible? Wow, that’s something.

[Unknown speaker]:
Isn’t this the scariest part? The person who says “I’m doing something funny” is the scariest one.
I want this MV to give off that kind of ennui—that melancholy mood.

[Unknown speaker]:
Do you know what ennui means?

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah, that… slightly different kind of ennui.
I’ll make an ennui face.
Ah, that’s beautiful. That’s cool. Now, play the drums!

[Unknown speaker]:
No, no, no way! I can’t! No way!

[Unknown speaker]:
A-chan, what did you want to do originally?
You said you wanted to be the boss, right?

[Unknown speaker]:
Wow—amazing! What’s this?
Lake Kawaguchi? Yeah, even Kawaguchi Lake—so beautiful.
Such great weather today!

[Unknown speaker]:
The atmosphere is perfect. I love Yamanashi—really nice.

[Unknown speaker]:
Beautiful place.

[Unknown speaker]:
Alright, let’s give it a try. Ready—go!

[Unknown speaker]:
Let’s do it, please! It’s like a bird—yeah, that pose reminds me of a bird.

[Unknown speaker]:
Exactly, the image is of a bird.

[Unknown speaker]:
Ah, I get it now.

[Unknown speaker]:
Hey, don’t flap like that! That’s the bird—that’s the bird!
That’s the bird pressed into the globe—see? Makes sense.
It’s a pet!

[Unknown speaker]:
Pet-like! I could fall asleep like this.

🎥 Filming Reflections

[Kanami]:
It was a little high up—scary! But good work, everyone!
We had so many different types of scenes this time—it’s been a while since we’ve done something like that.

[Akane]:
Yeah, it’s true.

[Kanami]:
In this one scene, I was all the way at the edge, and Sai-chan was over here.
I was supposed to reach out and touch Sai-chan’s hand—but Kobato, MISA, and A-chan were all in the way, blocking me!

[Akane]:
Blocking you! (laughs)

[Kanami]:
Yeah, totally blocked! You could even see it in the footage—we were struggling so hard! But it was fun.
It felt fresh. Really fresh.

This turned out to be a really cool MV,
so I hope everyone looks forward to watching it!

[MISA]
The shoot is officially finished!
The lighting effects were amazing,
and I think the visuals came out beautifully.
Please look forward to the final version!

Good work, everyone!

Kobato:
Under the starry sky, Kobato’s part is finished, po!
At the end, I accidentally splashed a bit of oolong tea on myself—don’t film that, po!
It’s fine, I’ll clean it up, po!

It was a long day of filming from morning to night,
but I think we were able to enjoy every bit of it, po!
I’m really excited to see how the finished version turns out, po!

It’s cold, po! Bye-bye, po! Bye-bye, po!
