✨ Omajinai Time – Kobato

Kobato:
Well then! After all that talking from Kobato, it’s time for our usual tradition—
this one’s part of it too, po!

Ah, no one said “Ohhh!” that time, po!
Back in the early days, people used to look at me like,
“What’s she doing? Huh? What’s this girl even saying?”
Like, “She keeps going po po po po—so noisy!”

But now, everyone joins in with “Ohhh!” Po!

So, Omajinai time!
For some of you Masters and Princesses, this might be your first time—amazing, po!
It’s rare for there to be so few who don’t know what it is. That makes me happy, po!

I’ll explain, po.

When Kobato says “Moe moe,” Masters and Princesses, you say:
“Moe moe!”

When Kobato says “Kyun kyun,” you say:
“Kyun kyun!”

We repeat these words together—it’s a special time where our hearts connect, po!
I’m so happy, po!

Even if today you don’t like Kobato that much—
even if you’re only here because Sai-chan told you to—
you still have to join in the Omajinai, po!

Now then, everyone, with your loudest voices—
loud enough to reach all the way across Shin-Kiba, maybe even Toyosu Station—
let’s go!

Keep it going, don’t stop midway, po!

Alright—let’s do it, po!

Kobato and audience:
Moe moe!
Moe moe!
Kyun kyun!
Moe moe!
Moe moe!
Kyun kyun!
Moe moe!
Moe moe!
Kyun kyun!

No, no, no, no! Po po po! That’s not it, po!
You can’t rest just because the people in the back are, po!

I know you all have stress—work stress, home stress,
all kinds of frustrations building up, po!

Everyone’s carrying something in this stressful society, po!

But today—just for today—
don’t throw all that at me, po!
Don’t copy me in your daily life, po!

Ah, fine! Go ahead—bring it all to me, po!
I’ll take it all on!

Moe moe!
Moe moe!

Wow, this really is a stressed-out society, po!

No way—now,
Moe moe!
Kyun kyun!
Kyun kyun!
Shinkyura! Shinkyura! (parodying “Shinryaku”/invasion)
Shinmeso! Shinryaku! (Invasion!)
Marome! Marome!
Mame! Mame! Mame! Mame! Mame! Mame!
