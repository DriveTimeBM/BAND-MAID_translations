🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (August)

Kanami:
Good day, everyone. How are you doing? It’s Kanamincho.

For August’s “Song of the Month,” there’s a word in the lyrics related to my favorite thing—coffee!

Right now, it’s still hard to go out much,
but once I can, I want to go to the beach and swim!
…Although, I actually can’t swim, haha.

So, my song of the month is “Catharsis.”

Bye-bye!
