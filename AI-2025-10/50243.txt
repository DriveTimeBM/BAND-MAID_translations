Kuruppo—Kobato Miku here, po!

🍶 Theme: “What Each Member Is Like When Drinking”

Kobato:
This is already our third fan club radio, po!
And today, we’re finally recording back in the studio, po!

All:
Yay!

Kobato:
We’re broadcasting from the official studio, po!
It’s been a long time since our remote recordings—how has everyone been, po?
It’s so nice to see everyone again, po!

Kanami:
Yeah, being face-to-face feels so different.

Akane:
Totally. The time lag during remote sessions was rough.

Kobato:
Kanami’s Wi-Fi used to always crash, po! It would freeze like kururururu... and stop, po!

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
So now that we’re back together, let’s dive right in, po!

The theme of today’s third episode is...
👉 “What Happens When Each BAND-MAID Member Drinks!”, po!

Saiki:
Oh boy.

Kobato:
A very BAND-MAID-like theme, don’t you think, po?
We’ve often joked that our afterparties are like pirate feasts, po!
So today, we’ll finally tell our Masters and Princesses what actually happens when we drink, po!

🍹 Kanami’s Rare Drinking Episode

Kobato:
Let’s start with Kanami, po!
Actually, there was a time during an Okyuji when she got tipsy, po!

Kanami:
No way—don’t tell that story!

Kobato:
Oh, but I must, po! It was at the Akasaka BLITZ Suika (Watermelon) show, po!
Kanami got really hyped and grabbed MISA’s drink, took a sip, and shouted into my mic:

“Come on! Isn’t this crowd too quiet? Let’s go!”

Then my mic smelled like alcohol afterward, po! I was so shocked!

Saiki:
That was hilarious.

Akane:
Yeah, I remember that!

Kobato:
It was so funny, po. That might be the only time Kanami has ever been even a little drunk, po.

Kanami:
Yeah… that was a rare one.

💤 Akane and the Sleepy Drinkers

Kobato:
Now for A-chan, po.
You’re not really a drinker, right, po?

Akane:
Not really. I fall asleep super fast.

Kobato:
Right, po! When we go drinking after shows, she’s always the first to say,

“I’m sleepy, I’m going back,”
and leaves early, po!

Saiki:
But then she actually comes back later!

Kobato:
Exactly, po! She goes back to her room, naps for a bit, and then returns to the afterparty, po!

Akane:
Yeah, once I’ve had a little nap, I’m fine again.

Kobato:
She’s amazing, po. And she can handle everyone drunk while staying completely sober, po!

MISA:
That’s impressive.

Kobato:
She can go all night with just oolong tea, po!

Saiki:
Seriously, that’s wild.

Kobato:
That’s talent, po.

🍷 Kobato’s Favorite: Dessert Wine

Kobato:
Oh! But A-chan can drink a little dessert wine now, po!

Akane:
Yeah, just a bit! There’s this really sweet one I like — from a winery called Kenzo Estate.

Kanami:
I want to try that!

Kobato:
Let’s have some on A-chan’s birthday, po!

Akane:
Okay, I’ll get it ready.

Kobato:
No, no, we’ll get it ready for you, po! (laughs)

🍺 Saiki and MISA’s Drunken Adventure

Kobato:
Okay, next up—Sai-chan, po!

Saiki:
Beer. Shochu. Barley. Lemon sours. That’s my range.

Kobato:
The other night, these two (Saiki and MISA) called me drunk around 10:30 p.m., po!

Saiki:
That was after we’d been drinking since 2 p.m.!

Kobato:
Yeah, and suddenly my phone rings and Sai-chan says,

“Kobato, help me… I don’t know where I am.”

I said, “That’s too early to be lost, po!”

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
Apparently, MISA lost memory around 9 p.m., and Saiki went blank at 10.
They were so drunk they forgot how to use GPS, po!

Saiki:
Yeah, I was like, “GPS? What’s that?”

Kobato:
I told her to use her phone’s map, and she said,

“There’s GPS on my phone?!”

I was like, “You called me on it, po!!” (laughs)

They even tried to take the train home before I convinced them to take a taxi.

Akane:
You’re like their emergency hotline.

Kobato:
Exactly, po! And when I tried to hang up, they yelled,

“Why are you hanging up on us?!”

I ended up staying on the phone for an hour and a half, po!

🧸 MISA’s “Pet Mode”

Kobato:
When MISA gets drunk, she becomes super cute, po!
She hugs me and says, “Kobatooo…” and starts crying, po!

Saiki:
Yeah, she becomes like a baby.

Kobato:
I pat her head like, “There, there, po,” and she purrs like a cat.
Sometimes she even falls asleep on my shoulder—perfect pillow, po!

Kanami:
That’s adorable.

Kobato:
Totally, po!

🧟 Kobato the “Zombie Maid”

Saiki:
But Kobato’s not innocent either.

Kobato:
Hey now, po!

Saiki:
When she drinks too much sake—like eight servings—she turns into a zombie.

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
That’s not true, po! I just get sleepy and walk around half-asleep, po!

Saiki:
Exactly—walking while sleeping!

Akane:
Like a horror movie.

Kobato:
If I drink that much, I’m done, po. But if others get drunk, I actually sober up, po.

Saiki:
Then let’s do a “Make Kobato Drunk” episode next time.

Kobato:
Nooo, po! I’d become Zombie Kobato, po!

⚡ “Pirate” Afterparties

Kobato:
Honestly, our afterparties really are like pirate banquets, po!
We eat a ton, drink a ton, and talk loudly, po!

Saiki:
It’s chaos, but fun.

Kobato:
Totally, po. Our Masters and Princesses may never see it,
but behind the scenes, BAND-MAID are happy pirates, po!

🎵 Song of the Night

Kobato:
Alright, it’s about time to wrap up, po!
Since this is a “drinking talk” episode,
Kanami will choose the closing song, po!

Kanami:
Okay! It’s a song that makes your drink go down way too easily.
Please enjoy — “Play”!

All:
Kanpai~!

✅ Notes:

Type: Late 2020 fan club “radio-style” studio talk.
