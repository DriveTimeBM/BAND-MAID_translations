🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (February 2022)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

February, of course, is the season for the big event of the month—Valentine’s Day!

Did everyone give or receive chocolates this year?

I bought some chocolates and canelés for myself.
Lately, I’ve been eating more sweets than usual.

I remembered how delicious the chocolate and cake were
in the Don’t You Tell Me MV—the ones I was nibbling on during that scene—
so my Song of the Month is “Don’t You Tell Me.”

See you next time!
