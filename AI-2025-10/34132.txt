## 🎉 Omajinai Time – Kobato (MISA’s Birthday Edition)

**Kobato:**  
Alright everyone, are your hearts ready, po?  
No “Ah, I’m a little embarrassed,” or “That’s not really my thing.”  
That’s not allowed, po! Even Kobato doesn’t hold back, po!  

Come on—get over here! Let’s go, po!  
Pon pon! Kyaa kyaa! Kyaa kyaa!  

Hey, you up there—your mouths aren’t moving! Kobato can see you, po!  
Alright then, let’s do it properly—repeat after me!  

Moe moe!  
Kyun kyun!  
Moe moe!  
Kyun kyun!  

Kan-kan! Ban-mei! Ban-mei! Ban-mei!  
Misa Misa Misa—Star!  
Misa Misa Misa—Star!  

Apparently, this chant even made it overseas, po.  
At some point, it turned into “Misa Misa Misa Star!”—  
but “Star” isn’t quite right, po! (laughs)  
Japanese hearts should connect properly, po!  

Now, once more!  
Misa Misa Misa—Star!  
Misa Misa Misa—Star!  

Misa Misa Misa!  
Misa Misa Misa!  

Missa! Missa! Missa!  
Missa! Missa! Missa!  

Last one—Missa! Missa! Missa!  
Missa! Missa! Missa!  

Sukkyun! Makkyun! Dokkyun!  
Happy Birthday to you!  
Happy Birthday to you!  
Happy Birthday to you, Missa!  

Let’s have fun tonight, po!  
Everyone, make some noise, po! Dokyume!
