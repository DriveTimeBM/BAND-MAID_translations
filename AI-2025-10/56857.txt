🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (May)

Hello, it’s Saiki.

Masters, how are you all doing?

For this month’s “Song of the Month,”
I think I’ll go with “Warning!”

The reason is that this month,
I’ve been doing a lot of decluttering and organizing,
and BAND-MAID’s faster-tempo songs really help me stay productive.

That’s it—see you!
