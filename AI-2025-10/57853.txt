🎙️ June 2021 – “Cooking Talk Special”

Kobato (MC):
Welcome home, Masters and Princesses, po!
Kuruppo—this is Kobato Miku, po!

Saiki:
Saiki.

Kanami:
Kanami.

Akane:
Akane.

MISA:
MISA.

🍳 Theme: “Our Special Dishes”

Kobato:
This is already our fifth fan club radio, po!
We thought we’d dig deeper into who we really are—so today’s topic is:
Our best dishes in the kitchen, po!

Who wants to go first, po?

Kanami:
Hmm… I wonder what Sai-chan’s specialty is?

Kobato:
Ah, I’m curious too, po!

Kanami:
Sai-chan’s omelet rice is amazing—soft, fluffy, and melty.

Kobato:
I’ve heard that, po! So, Sai-chan, what’s your best dish, po?

Saiki:
Hamburg steak. Definitely.

Kobato:
Ah, so that’s it, po! That’s a good one—classic!

Kanami:
And your stuffed peppers were good too.

Kobato:
They keep coming, po! So, Sai-chan’s specialty is hamburg steak. It’s her favorite to make too, po!

🍝 Kanami’s Pasta Obsession

Kobato:
Alright, Kanami-chan—what’s your specialty, po?

Kanami:
Pasta! Probably oil-based pasta.

I bought a cookbook by Chef Ochiai, and during lockdown last year, when we couldn’t go out or eat at restaurants,
I really wanted to eat good pasta.
So I practiced over and over with his recipes—like, dozens of times—and now I can make really tasty pasta!

Kobato:
That’s wonderful, po! Definitely a true specialty, po!

🍅 MISA’s Tomato Magic

Kobato:
Okay, MISA-chan, your turn, po!

MISA:
Hmm… Akane, what do you think mine is?

Akane:
You want me to guess? Well, I’ve eaten your food the most.
I’d say… something tomato-based?

Kobato:
Oh, I can totally see that, po!

MISA:
Yeah, maybe tomato stews or creamy simmered dishes. I’ve made things like stuffed cabbage rolls before too.

Kobato:
I remember those, po! You’re great with stews. So your specialty is tomato-based cooking, po!

MISA:
Yeah, that’s fair. But the thing I make most often just for myself is yaki-udon (fried udon).

Kobato:
Oh, that sounds delicious, po!

MISA:
I make it with kombu and mirin—it’s simple but perfect.

Kobato:
Kombu and mirin flavor, po! Very homey, po!

🥔 Kobato’s Korokke & Hotpot

Kanami:
Kobato, yours must be korokke (croquettes), right?

Kobato:
Yes, po! I used to make them for my family, and they’d disappear instantly, po!

But recently, I haven’t made korokke much.
What I make most often now is pot-au-feu and mille-feuille hotpot with pork belly and cabbage, po!

MISA:
Those are so good.

Kobato:
Right, po? I love arranging the layers in a perfect circle—
it’s kind of meditative, po!

🍳 Saiki’s Sweet Tamagoyaki

Kobato:
So, what about Sai-chan, po? Any other specialties?

Saiki:
Tamagoyaki (rolled omelet).

Akane:
So good! You’ve made it for me twice.

Kobato:
Lucky, po! What kind of flavor, po?

Saiki:
Sweet—made with sugar and a little mayonnaise.

Kobato:
Ahh, sweet style, po! That’s similar to mine, po.

Kanami:
My mom also loves sweet tamagoyaki.

MISA:
I like both sweet and savory versions!

🐟 Akane’s “Soul à la Meunière” (??)

Kobato:
Alright, A-chan—your turn, po! What’s your specialty dish?

Akane:
Hmm… Nabe (hotpot)?
Or maybe… sole à la meunière!

Kobato:
Wait, what?!

Saiki:
Did you just say “soul à la meunière”?

Kobato:
She’s literally checking her phone for the recipe, po!

Akane:
No, no! It’s simple—I make it with cod too, not just sole.

Kobato:
You don’t even buy fish, po!

Akane:
I buy cod! I love gindara (black cod). I even put it in hotpot.

Kobato:
Okay, okay, we’ll let that one slide, po!
But now that you’ve said it’s your specialty, you’ll have to cook it for us next time, po!

🍶 Snacks and Drinks Pairings

Kobato:
We still have time, po!
Let’s talk about what we like to eat or drink together with our cooking, po!

So, MISA—what’s your go-to pairing, po?

MISA:
Beer.

Kobato:
Of course, po! That’s obvious, po!

Saiki:
Yeah, beer always. And I make dishes that match beer—stronger seasoning, saltier.

Kobato:
Right, po!

What about quick bar snacks, po?

Akane:
Oh! That shirataki and green pepper stir-fry you made was delicious.

MISA:
Ah, yeah! I just cut shirataki noodles and bell peppers, add jako (tiny fish),
and season with soy sauce and hondashi.

Kobato:
That’s basically a dish made to eat hondashi, po! (laughs)

MISA:
Exactly! Strong hondashi flavor, light soy sauce—simple but great.

Kobato:
Hondashi really is a miracle seasoning, po!

🥚 Akane’s Okra with Soft-Boiled Egg

Kobato:
And A-chan, what’s something you make often, po?

Akane:
Okra with soft-boiled egg.

Kobato:
Ahh, I remember that one, po!

Akane:
I make it almost every day.

Kanami:
Every day?!

Akane:
Pretty much. Just wash and cut the okra, microwave for 3 minutes,
add mentsuyu and a little soy sauce, top with a soft-boiled egg, and mix.

Kobato:
Do you buy the eggs already soft-boiled, po?

Akane:
I make them myself sometimes.

Kobato:
Amazing, po! You can even make your own soft-boiled eggs, po!

Akane:
Yeah, it’s easy—you just time it right when boiling.

🎵 Closing Song

Kobato:
Alright, we’re out of time, po!
For the fifth episode’s ending song, I, Kobato, will choose, po!

It’s a song that really pushed me to my limit when performing, po!
Everyone, can you guess what it is, po?

MISA:
Summer Drive?

Kobato:
Wrong, po! That’s ancient, po! Some fans listening now might not even know that one, po!

Kanami:
Big Dad?

Kobato:
Even older, po! You’re just going further back in time, po!

The correct answer is… “Sayonakidori” (Little Bird).

Please enjoy!
