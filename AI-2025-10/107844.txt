[Kobato]
Welcome home, Masters and Princesses! This is BAND-MAID, po!  
And would you look at that — 2024 is almost over, po.  
So today, we’ll be looking back on the past year together and having a fun little “BAND-MAID Year-End Party,” po!

Let’s start with quick introductions, po.  
I’m Kobato, po! Nice to meet you, po!  

Kanami here — guitar.

Saiki, vocals.

Akane, drums.

MISA, bass.

[Kobato]
All right, first things first — let’s start with a toast, po!  
MISA-chan, can you do the honors?

[Unknown Speaker]
Eh? Me? The toast signal?

[Kobato]
Yeah, go ahead, open it!

[Unknown Speaker]
Okay… three, two, one — cheers!

[Everyone]
Cheers!!

[Kobato]
All right, let’s enjoy some snacks and chat about the year, po.  
We’ll go month by month — from January to December — and remember what happened.

So, January.  
That was mostly recording season — getting ready for the next live shows and rehearsals.

We actually spent the start of the year together at MISA-chan’s house, remember?  
We always end up gathering there for New Year’s (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, that’s kind of become a tradition now.

[Unknown Speaker]
And that’s how 2024 began — together at MISA’s place.  
We started recording *Epic Narrative* around then.

[Unknown Speaker]
I remember recording vocals on January 9th.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right! That was right after the New Year. Busy from the start.

[Unknown Speaker]
Then in February — the 10th Anniversary Extra Show at KT Zepp Yokohama!

[Unknown Speaker]
That was huge. I’d always wanted to play there.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, and since it was an “extra edition,” we got to perform songs that didn’t fit into the main 10th Anniversary Tour.  
Even though the show was almost four hours long, it still didn’t feel like enough!

[Unknown Speaker]
(laughs) It really didn’t!

[Unknown Speaker]
Oh, and there was that whole shrimp incident (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
Don’t remind me…

[Unknown Speaker]
You were so eager about shrimp this year, po! (laughs)

[Unknown Speaker]
It’s because the other day, when we went out to eat, I accidentally ate Akane’s shrimp!  
She told me to go ahead, and I just reflexively said “Okay” and ate it.  
Then I realized what I’d done (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
And that’s why we made sure everyone gets two shrimp tonight (laughs).  
Anyway — on to March!

March was our *acoustic Okyuji*! It had been so long since the last one with a live audience.  
The stage design was like a “concert in the forest” — it felt so magical.

[Unknown Speaker]
Saiki played piano for *Daydreaming*, right?

[Saiki]
Yeah, that was nerve-wracking but really special.

[Unknown Speaker]
You were great! Your sense of rhythm was spot-on, po.  
It was a really beautiful concert.

Then April — *Bestie* was released online!  
That was the one we made with Mikey from The Warning.

[Unknown Speaker]
Ah yes, “Mikey-chan”! She’s such a legend, and so nice.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right? She came to Japan so quickly after we met at the festival!

[Unknown Speaker]
She’s super light-footed — “fukkaru” (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
And remember the music video shoot? MISA’s outfit ended up being too short!

[Unknown Speaker]
Ugh, yeah. They didn’t have time for fittings, so when I put it on that morning, the legs were way too short (laughs).  
They had to hide it in the video with props and lighting!

[Unknown Speaker]
That MV was so pretty though — the shadows, the lighting, everything.  
Saiki’s silhouette during the chorus was so cool.

[Unknown Speaker]
That was producer magic, po! Such a great result.

Then in May — *Maid Day*!  
We performed with **Incubus** at Tokyo Garden Theater. It was incredible.  
Our first time truly sharing the stage with another major band like that, not just as an opener.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right, and Mikey even joined us on stage again for *Bestie*! It was amazing.

[Unknown Speaker]
They were all so kind. Total legends, but humble and friendly.

Then June — The Warning came to Japan!  
We made a collaboration song, filmed a music video, and played a two-man show together.  
We also went out for ramen like four days in a row (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
They loved ramen so much! Especially the spicy kind.

[Unknown Speaker]
They even learned how to slurp noodles properly (laughs).  
They said it was the best ramen they’d ever had in their lives!

[Unknown Speaker]
It was so hard to say goodbye after that. We all cried.  
They were such wonderful people.

[Unknown Speaker]
That same month, our hall tour began — and MISA’s signature Black Smoker bass was officially released!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah! I used to think I’d never want to release a signature model — it felt too personal.  
But as time passed, my mindset changed. I wanted to share it.  
I’m so proud of it.

[Unknown Speaker]
Everyone’s waiting to get one, po!

Then July — the Hall Tour continued, from Nagoya to Osaka to Kanagawa.  
Akane even got to perform at the same hall where she competed in band contests back in school!

[Akane]
Yeah! It was so emotional.  
Back then I played trombone there — this time, I got to perform as a drummer.  
Full circle!

[Unknown Speaker]
What a year already, po. And that’s just up to July!

(Conversation continues in Part 2…)
