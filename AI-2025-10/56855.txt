🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (June)

Kobato:
How are you all doing, po? It’s Kobato Miku, po!

June already—time flies, po!
And now it’s the rainy season, po.

As a pigeon, I’m not very good with rain, po…
But when it rains, I always think of the song “Mirage,” po!

Of course, upbeat songs that can blow away the gloomy weather are great too,
but sometimes, it’s nice to sip some coffee while listening to a song like “Mirage”
and quietly soak in the atmosphere, po.

That’s why my “Song of the Month” is “Mirage,” po!

Bye-bye, po!
