**Akane:**
Here’s a little behind-the-scenes story from **Maid Day**!

On my way to the venue, I spotted a capsule toy machine for *Haikyuu!!*,  
the anime I’m currently obsessed with. I really wanted to try it,  
but I didn’t have any coins with me—so I couldn’t.  

Feeling a little down, I went into the venue,  
and before rehearsal I ran into **Kurutto-san (Kobato)** and greeted her.  
When I told her that I couldn’t play the capsule machine,  
she handed me **400 yen** and said,  
“Here, go play the gacha, po!”  

Kurutto-san, thank you so much.  
After that, I gave my absolute best during the live show!  

Let’s go eat cake together again sometime!
