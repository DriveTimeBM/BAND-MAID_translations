ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Saiki (5 of 10)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. Itâ€™s Saiki.

Today, Iâ€™ll be introducing Kanami-chan.

Kanami-chan never shows her funny faces to me.
Sheâ€™s a bit of a playful person who believes whatever random things I say.

Sometimes, she suddenly forgets how to speak Japanese properly,
and when you feed her whipped cream, she gets really happy.

Thatâ€™s all.
