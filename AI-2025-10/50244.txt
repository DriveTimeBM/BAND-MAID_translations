🌟 “Different” Release Celebration

Kobato:
This is already our fourth fan club radio, po!
And today’s episode is a special edition, po!
We’ll be talking all about our new song “Different,” released on December 2nd, po!

All:
Congratulations!

Kobato:
Congratulations to everyone, po!
Let’s dive right in and talk about it—starting with some recording stories, po!

🎧 Recording Stories

Kobato:
The recording for Different actually happened quite a long time ago—
about a year before the release, po!

MISA:
Yeah, it’s been ages.

Kobato:
Right, po! So much has happened since then—new album, tours, lockdowns...
We’ve been really busy, po!

Akane:
And we were writing songs constantly, too.

Kobato:
I remember recording Different around the same time as Kan Kanara (from Conqueror), po!

Saiki:
Yeah, that’s right!

Kobato:
It was one of the first songs we finished that year.
Since it was being made as an anime opening theme, we had to move quickly and coordinate with the production team, po!

🥁 The Rhythm and Speed

Kobato:
This song is fast, po!
Isn’t this the first full song where we used two-beat rhythm all the way through, A-chan, po?

Akane:
Yeah, that’s right. Before this, we only used two-beat for short sections, like during solos.
This was the first time we did it from start to finish.

Kobato:
It’s exhausting, po! Kanami-chan’s melodies are nonstop, po!

Kanami:
I know—it’s a really packed song.

Saiki:
It was tough to sing, too. I remember muttering “Damn it!” in the studio.

Kobato:
But you nailed it, po! That’s why we have such a cool, powerful vocalist, po!

🖋️ Lyric Writing

Kobato:
The lyrics were also challenging, po!
Since Different was for the anime Log Horizon: Destruction of the Round Table,
I read the original novel first, po!

It was full of complex words—not everyday Japanese—so I worked hard to reflect that tone.
Some phrases, like “content notification” (コンテント告知), were so obscure I had to look them up multiple times, po!

Saiki:
I didn’t even know how to read it at first!

Kobato:
Same here, po! It didn’t show up even when I searched online!

Because the song moves at such a fast pace,
I had to mix Japanese and English carefully so it wouldn’t sound like a tongue twister, po.

That’s how lines like “One time… once more!” came about, po!

Akane:
And that’s why it’s so good for practicing pronunciation—it’s practically a tongue-twister song.

Kobato:
Exactly, po! Everyone should try singing it for diction training, po!

🎤 The Challenge of Singing BAND-MAID Songs

Kanami:
Actually, Different ended up being the first BAND-MAID song
where the printed lyrics filled two full A4 pages!

All:
What?!

Kobato:
Yeah, normally it’s just one page—so this one’s packed, po!
So many words!

Saiki:
It’s a workout for your mouth.

Kobato:
Totally, po!

🎶 Karaoke and Song Difficulty

Kobato:
Speaking of singing—it’s tough to sing BAND-MAID songs at karaoke, right, po?

All:
Very!

Kobato:
The rhythms are tricky, the melodies move fast…

Akane:
Yeah, even if you know the pitch in your head,
your body just can’t keep up sometimes.

Kobato:
Exactly, po! We’ve all tried our own songs at karaoke before,
and we still end up out of sync, po!

MISA:
Especially when you’re drinking!

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
We should do a “Drunk BAND-MAID Karaoke” episode someday, po!

MISA:
No way, I refuse!

Kanami:
We’d get way too into it.

Saiki:
You’d just end up crying again, MISA.

MISA:
That’s why I’m not doing it! (laughs)

Kobato:
(laughs) We’ll save that for another time, po!

🎵 Fan Connection & Future Hopes

Kobato:
Once it’s safe again, we’d love to go to karaoke together, po!
For now, everyone, please practice singing at home, po!

Akane:
Yeah, I’ll be training hard at home too.

Kobato:
Same here, po!
And please check out the Log Horizon anime while you listen to Different!
It’s such a cool combination, po!

Kanami:
Yeah, the visuals and music match perfectly.

Kobato:
And we saw the Log Horizon director’s comments on Twitter—so full of love, po!
That made us really happy!

So everyone, please check those out too, po!

✨ Closing

Kobato:
And that wraps up the fourth BAND-MAID fan club radio, po!
We hope you enjoy Different even more after hearing our stories, po!

Now, please listen to BAND-MAID’s “Different.”

All:
Enjoy!
