🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (September)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

Did you see it, po?
The Netflix film “Kate” was released, po!

We filmed our scenes for it in Thailand around late September 2019, po.
It was full of first-time experiences for all of us, and it was so much fun, po!

Right after the Thailand shoot, we headed straight to our U.S. tour,
so it was quite a hectic time, but looking back,
it really was such an intense and unforgettable stretch of days, po.

I want to go overseas for Okyuji again soon, po!

And for this month’s song—my pick is “Choose Me,” po!

Bye-bye, po~!
