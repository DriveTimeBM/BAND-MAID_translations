Akane:
Hello, Masters and Princesses!
Itâ€™s Akane.

Howâ€™s everyone spending their time at home?

As for me, when Iâ€™m at home, I use my practice pads for hands and feet to do exercises I can do indoorsâ€”
Iâ€™ve been working every day on strengthening my basic drumming technique.

And Iâ€™ve also been using the Ring Fit Adventure game on the Nintendo Switch
for muscle training and stretching!

Itâ€™s just as effective as going to the gym,
so Iâ€™m doing my best to keep it up every day.

Iâ€™ll give you another update soon, okay?
Letâ€™s all keep doing our best together!

Thatâ€™s all from Akane.
Bye-bye! ðŸ‘‹
