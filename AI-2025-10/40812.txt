🎥 Akane’s Figure Collection Talk — English Translation

Akane:
Hey everyone, it’s Akane!

Today, I want to show you all some of my favorite figures!
I really love figures — I’ve collected dozens of them —
but most of them are still back at my parents’ house.

So today, I brought a few of my favorites to show you.
Let’s get started!

💙 Evangelion Time!

First up, let’s start with Evangelion!
Ta-dah!
Here’s Rei Ayanami!

This one was actually a present from our guitarist, Kanamincho!
Isn’t it beautiful? She’s so pretty — I love it.

And speaking of Ayanami,
this isn’t exactly a figure —
but this is the very first plastic model I ever built!

Ta-dah! Unit-00!

This one took me a long time.
It wasn’t something I could finish in one day —
it took me two full days!

I worked so hard on it.
Look — it’s Unit-00!

Isn’t it great?
They even captured the slightly hunched posture perfectly.
The details are amazing — the wrists and legs actually move!
So intricate!

So yes, the first plastic model I ever made —
this one right here, Unit-00!

❤️ Asuka Figures — Unboxing Ceremony!

Next up, I want to show you some new ones I got this year!
But… honestly, they were too nice to open,
so I’ve kept them sealed in their boxes until now.

So I thought — why not open them together with all of you,
my dear OMEISYUSAMA?
Let’s have a little unboxing ceremony!

And the star this time is…
Asuka!

Yes, Asuka, Asuka!
I’ve got three of them —
still unopened until today!

Alright, let’s open them up!
Let the unboxing ceremony begin!

Ta-dah!
Amazing!

This is the Asuka from Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo —
the “Q” movie version, in her plug suit.

It’s perfect — absolutely perfect!

Okay, let’s open the next one too.
Here we go — open!
Wow, look at this!

Incredible!
The slightly sideways glance — that’s such an Asuka expression!

The texture is amazing —
the mix of matte and shiny surfaces,
and the soft flow of her hair — so well made!

It’s so beautiful.
The hair quality is incredible!
Another Q version Asuka — absolutely stunning.

💫 My Favorite Asuka

Now this next one is super cute —
this one’s my top recommendation!

It’s Asuka from Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance,
the “Ha” version!

For those wondering what I mean by “Q” or “Ha,”
Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition is a movie series made up of four films:
the first is “Jo,”
then “Ha,”
then “Q,”
and finally the last one, “Shin.”

(Here, “Shin Evangelion” means the final film in the series.)

It was actually supposed to premiere in June 2020,
but it got postponed… so I’ve been looking forward to it ever since!

Anyway — let’s open this one!
Ta-dah!

Ahh, she’s adorable!
Just look at that face!
And that pose — it’s so Asuka!

She’s too cute!

I wanted this one so badly —
I really wanted to bring her home.

The plug suit design is just perfect, isn’t it?
So cute… seriously.

Everyone, look at her face —
so cute!

I’ll definitely display her carefully.

⏰ Ending (and Apology)

Now, I have something I need to tell everyone…

Umm…
I went way over time.
(laughs)

Yaaay— …No wait, not yay! I’m gonna get scolded.

If I leave it uncut,
I actually talked for over 30 minutes!

I got way too fired up!

So if I ended it here,
it would feel incomplete, right?
That’s why I decided —
I’ll make a Part 2!

I really want to show you all the rest of my favorite figures properly,
so please look forward to the next video —
the Figure Favorites, Part 2!

Thank you so much for sticking with me this far!
Sorry for going so long! (laughs)

Alright — see you in the next video!
This was Akane! Bye-bye! 👋

📝 Cultural & Tone Notes for Fans

“フィギュア” (figure) = collectible anime statues or models.

“プラモデル” (pla-model) = plastic assembly kits, like Gundam or Evangelion mecha.

“進撃のQ / ハ / 序 / シン” = shorthand for the four Rebuild of Evangelion films.

Akane’s tone is casual, energetic, slightly geeky — she’s genuinely excited.
She slips into “otaku talk” comfortably, showing her warm and humorous side.

Her “尺がオーバー” joke (“I went over time”) shows her self-awareness and playfulness with fans — a recurring charm in her solo videos.
