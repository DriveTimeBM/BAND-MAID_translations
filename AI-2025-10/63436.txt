🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (October)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

My “Song of the Month” is “Sense.”

October 7 marks the broadcast of the anime Platinum End,
and October 27 is the release date of “Sense.”

So, of course, I had to choose this song for October!

Did you watch Platinum End?
I got goosebumps the entire time from how amazing the opening animation was.

I’m really looking forward to each new episode every week.

Please look forward to hearing the full version of “Sense” too!

That’s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
