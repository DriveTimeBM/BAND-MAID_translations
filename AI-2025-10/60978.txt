🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (August)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

Kobato’s “Song of the Month” for this time is “Smile,” po!

These days have been pretty tough and lonely, haven’t they, po?

When I think about “Smile,” I remember that the lyrics were written
while thinking about all the Masters and Princesses, po.
It makes me recall those times during Okyuji, po.

I want to do Okyuji in front of everyone again soon, po!
When we can meet, let’s show each other lots of smiles, po!

Bye-bye, po~!
