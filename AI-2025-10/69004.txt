🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (February 2022)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

This month’s song is “alone,” po!

February, of course, was Valentine’s Day, po!

Every year, I buy myself chocolates from the Morozoff × Miffy collaboration,
but this year, I couldn’t get them, po.

So out of frustration, I decided to make cookies myself for the first time in a while, po!
I bought a Miffy-shaped cookie cutter and used a chocolate pen to draw her face,
but getting the eyes balanced was so hard, po!

I want to try making them again, po.

Bye-bye, po~!
