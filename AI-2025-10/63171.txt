🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (October)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

For this month’s “Song of the Month,”
I’ll choose “endless Story.”

Since October is also the release month for “Sense,”
I did consider picking that one…
but in the end, I felt that “endless Story”
fits the mood of October’s atmosphere better.

Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
