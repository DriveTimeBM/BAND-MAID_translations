🎵 Song of the Month – Akane

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

My “Song of the Month” is “NO GOD.”

Ever since Maid Day ended, my energy for Okyuji and for drums hasn’t cooled down at all.
I’ve been feeling this strong drive—like, “I want to do more! I can do better!” before the next Okyuji.

The lyrics of “NO GOD,” like “Those who have fun are the winners” and “Break your limits and go beyond everything,”
really hit me deeply right now.

That’s why I chose “NO GOD.”

Everyone, please give it a listen too.

See you!
