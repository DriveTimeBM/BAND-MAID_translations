🎥 Maid’s Room – Pick to Slap Technique

MISA:
Hello everyone, it’s MISA.

Today I’d like to give a simple explanation of a technique I often use while playing —
switching between pick and slap, and slap back to pick.
Thank you for watching.

First, here’s my pick.
I haven’t really talked about my picks before,
but mine are just a little larger than normal —
maybe about one size bigger than a typical one.
They’re also not very stiff.

If you know the Dunlop picks you often see in music shops,
mine is about halfway between the green and yellow ones in hardness.

Yay. 🎶

So, to make it easy to understand,
I’ll show you while holding the pick.

Here’s how I hold it.
Like this—
and then I play like this.
Then I wedge it here (between fingers).
From there, I move like this, and wedge it again—
yeah, like “mm, mm, mm”—that’s the feeling.

Everyone, try it out.

Alright, let’s use the bass and play it.

It’s just this repeated motion—like this.

First, I’ll try it slowly, using the A section of “Bubble.”
Here’s the phrase—could you see it?

Since “Bubble” has a slower tempo,
I think it’s easy to practice with.

Okay, now I’ll play it along with the track.

Like this.

By the way, there’s also a version where you don’t wedge the pick —
you just use a pull (slap) instead.

Like this — while keeping the pick held between your fingers,
you pluck using your middle finger.

That’s another way to do it.

Alright, next, let’s try something at about the same tempo as “Bubble” —
let’s go with “Wonderland.”
I’ll play the A section with the track.

Like this.

If you try it slowly, it’s like this:
During the moment when the pick is floating,
you slip it into place again.

And that’s about it for today.

I hope we can all practice this together sometime,
maybe on an Instagram Live or something like that.

Let’s work on this together.

See you again!

✅ Notes:

The song titles “Bubble” and “Wonderland” are explicitly mentioned by MISA in the text.

This is a clear, instructional vlog — simple, technical, and relaxed.

Tone: calm, focused, slightly casual; typical of her teaching videos.
