## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Akane (3 of 10)

**Akane:**
Hello, Masters and Princesses! It’s Akane.

Today I’ll be introducing **Sai-chan**!

About five or six years ago, the two of us formed what we call our **“Goof-Off Duo.”**  
Sai-chan is my partner in that team!

We go to parks and play around, come up with our own games, and even battle each other—  
our concept is *“having fun without spending money.”*  

Even though she always has this cool and mature aura,  
she also has an incredibly **childlike and playful side**,  
and that contrast is exactly what you’d call *gap moe*!  

Please keep supporting our amazing vocalist, **Saiki**, the ultimate one—“Sai-kyuu!”  

That’s all from Akane.
