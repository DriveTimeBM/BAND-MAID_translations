**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! I’ll be answering a question, po!  

The question is: “Why did you decide to make *Rinne* have a Japanese title?”  

Well, I thought “Reincarnation” in English sounded cool too, po!  
But I wanted something that would make a **strong visual impact** from the title alone, po!  
That’s why I chose the kanji **輪廻 (Rinne)**, po.  

For songs like “Catharsis,” I felt that using **katakana** better conveyed both the **look and the meaning**,  
so that’s why I went with that, po!  

I’m actually quite particular about titles—  
I often reconsider them depending on the **nuance** I want,  
and I even discuss the **appearance** with Sai-chan before deciding, po!  

So from now on, please pay attention to how the titles are chosen, po!  

That was Kobato, po! Bye-bye, po!
