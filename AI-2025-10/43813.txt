## 💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – MISA (1 of 4)

**MISA:**
Hello, it’s MISA.  

This time, I’ll be answering a question from *Zumi-san* on Twitter:  
“When you use an amp other than your 4-Stroke, what kind of settings do you usually use?  
I’m struggling to find my tone, so I’d love to know for reference.”  

In my case, when I’m using an amp I’ve never tried before,  
of course, I want to see how much of my **own sound** I can bring out of it.  

But first, I always want to **understand the amp’s natural character**,  
so I start by setting the **Bass, Mid, and High** knobs right in the middle.  

From there, I tweak things little by little to shape the tone I want.  

Please try experimenting and finding your sound too!  
Thanks for the question. Bye-bye!
