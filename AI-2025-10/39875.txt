🎥 Maid’s Room – MISA’s Snack Time #1

MISA:
Good evening. It’s MISA.

Today, I’m going to make a little snack to go with drinks. 🍶

Alright, let’s start by cutting up some vegetables.
First, the onion.
Then, the daikon radish.
And the carrot—someone’s helping me cut that one.

We’re cutting them all in half—just rough cuts.

Next, I’m cutting the chicken.
I’ve already removed the skin.
But don’t worry, I’ll use the skin later for something else.

MISA:
Cheers! 🍺

Ahh… delicious.

Now, I’m adding green beans to the pot.
Since I don’t have any cooking sake,
I’ll just use regular sake instead.

We’ll let that simmer.

Mmm. The beer tastes amazing.

MISA:
Okay, remember that chicken skin from earlier?
I’m using it now!

I’m frying it together with garlic and garlic shoots,
and turning it into yakitori-style skewers on the frying pan. 🍢

MISA:
And… done!

Today I made two dishes:
a nimono (simmered dish)
and grilled chicken skin with garlic and garlic shoots.

Alright, let’s eat.

First—cheers again! 🍺

It’s delicious.

I added garlic and garlic shoots this time
to help boost the immune system. 💪

(Another sip.)
So good.

MISA:
Everyone, please enjoy your time at home too, okay?

See you later~
