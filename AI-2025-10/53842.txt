🎥 Maid’s Room – Akane & MISA’s Summer Festival Vlog

Akane:
Hey everyone, it’s Akane!

Today, I’m actually visiting a very special guest’s home to film this episode.
Alright, let’s bring in today’s special guest!

Please welcome… Mr. I-Love-Alcohol!

MISA:
It’s me, Mr. I-Love-Alcohol.

Akane:
Yes, that’s right—Mr. I-Love-Alcohol herself, MISA! 🍶

So, what are we making today?

🧁 Let’s Make Festival Snacks!

MISA:
Hey, don’t spoil it yet!
Since we couldn’t go to any summer festivals this year,
I thought, “Why not just make our own festival at home?”

And I found something perfect for it—this right here.

Akane:
Can you all see this?
It’s called “Fun Festival Stand.”
Wait… isn’t this the kind of toy for kids?

It’s a DIY candy set!
We’re going to play “festival shop” together today.
Alright, let’s get started!

🍎 Apple Candy, Fries, and Corn-on-the-Cob (Candy-Style)

MISA:
First, we need to cut the tray into three parts.
I’m really bad at this kind of thing…

Akane:
Yeah, you are! You’re super clumsy! (laughs)
You’re not good with tiny stuff like this.

Oops, I dropped it! Wow, look at that!

MISA:
Next, let’s make the apple candy.

Akane:
Okay—apple candy, done!
Now, step three—let’s make the french fries!

Ta-da! Fries complete!

MISA:
Let’s make corn-on-the-cob next.

Akane:
All done—corn-on-the-cob!
And finally… chocolate bananas, right?

MISA:
Yup, time for chocolate bananas!

Akane:
Chocolate bananas are done!
Chocolate bananas are done! (laughs)

And now… the last one—apple candy again!

Finished!
Crispy and fun—wait, we’re not supposed to fry this! (laughs)

MISA:
That’s not batter?

Akane:
Batter? No, it’s crispy—like a pineapple?

MISA:
Yeah.

Akane:
It’s like pineapple-flavored fries! (laughs)

MISA:
Let’s try the corn next—corn!
You eat this from the side, right?

Akane:
From the side? How does that even work? (laughs)

Oh, I get it—it’s like Hi-Chew candy!
Corn Hi-Chew with little bumps!

Mmm, that’s good.
Should we try the apple candy next?

MISA:
Summer’s so much fun.

Akane:
Yeah, it really is.
It feels like summer now.
Fireworks next! Let’s go see fireworks!

Fireworks! Fireworks! (laughs)

MISA:
Gelatin… oh wait, it’s pink candy. My bad—it’s pink candy.

Oops—made a mistake. Chocolate banana time.
It didn’t harden at all.

This one’s probably the one you made, Akane.

Akane:
Yeah, probably. (laughs)
Does it taste okay?

MISA:
Yeah… it’s good. It has a… unique taste. (laughs)

Akane:
Alright then, I’m eating the chocolate banana too.

Done!
All finished!

And that’s our little summer festival!
That was so much fun.

Finally, we got to do something summery together!

MISA:
Yeah, it was delicious.
But now I really want some actual fries.

Let’s go get fries after this. Bye-bye!

Akane:
Bye-bye! 👋

💬 Cultural & Fan Notes

MISA = “Osake Sukisuki Man” (お酒スキスキマン): Akane jokingly introduces her as “Mr. I-Love-Alcohol,” referencing MISA’s well-known fondness for whisky and beer.

Festival Candy Kit: They’re using a Japanese dagashi (cheap candy) DIY toy set called “Tanoshii Omatsuri-san”, where you make miniature “festival foods” out of edible candy powder.

Akane’s role: She’s clearly the host—bubbly, playful, talkative.

MISA’s role: Dry humor, quiet but funny one-liners, the perfect comedic balance to Akane.

Mood: Cozy, light-hearted, nostalgic — the kind of “off-stage” fun BAND-MAID fans love seeing.
