🎬 BAND-MAID – “Warning!” MV: Behind the Scenes

Kobato (Speaker 1):
A-chan, that angle looks super cool, po! Cool? So cool, po!

Why? Because Kanami’s facing the other way, her back’s to you, and there’s a staff member holding an umbrella on the side with the makeup artist—it just looks so cinematic, po! That angle—that’s the word, po!

I can’t even talk, po. That angle’s amazing. It looks like one of those bands, po!

A-chan’s totally the star today—drummer-vocalist Akane, po!

Akane (Speaker 2):
Is it fun? Oh, super fun! You don’t get to do something like this often in life, you know?

It’s my first time doing this, and I’m so glad I did! Really glad.

What’s that? …Fire!

[Unknown speaker]:
Did you say wire emblem?

Kobato:
Fire? What did you say, po? Fire?

What was it? What did she say, po?

[Unknown speaker]:
Fire Emblem! Or, wait, Emblem? What was it again? Fire Emblem—isn’t that a game?

Yeah, there’s a game called Fire Emblem, right? A game? A game, yeah!

🎥 After Filming

Akane & MISA:
It’s done—yay! Thank you, everyone! It’s finished!
We did it! Thank you! I feel so refreshed!

It was such a busy shoot, but seriously, getting to film something like this—
it felt like being in a Hollywood movie!

I want everyone to watch this as soon as possible!
Really, I want each person to watch it 100 times!
Actually, no—100 isn’t enough. Please watch it many, many times!
It’s the best! Did you see it?

Kanami (Speaker 3):
Yeah—I was Crusher Kanami.

Kobato:
Crusher?

Kanami:
Crusher Kanami!

Kobato:
Crusher Kanami? That’s a first! I thought the members weren’t there,
but you were, right?

Kobato:
I thought no one was there, po—it was lonely, po!
But you were all there after all, po.

Thank you for your hard work!

💥 Explosions & Reflections

Saiki:
It didn’t rain or snow, so I remembered filming Nonfiction Days.
I wanted to keep an eye on the director until the end,
and I’m really grateful for this shoot.

There were so many firsts for me—
my first explosion scene, and my first time singing inside a car!

It’s definitely going to be a lasting memory.
