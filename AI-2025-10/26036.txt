🎬 BAND-MAID – “Bubble” MV: Behind the Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
Yay! It’s shooting time!

[Akane]:
Barefoot destiny. That’s the fate of being barefoot!

[Akane]:
We’ve got heat packs here — the curse of going barefoot. Are your feet warm?
And there’s Kanami—she looks great in that scarf.
Now, let’s sneak into the waiting room where the two vocalists are resting!

It looks like a stylish café in here.

[Akane]:
That’s Kobato-san. Kobato-san is really close to the camera!

[Akane]:
Her breathing is hilarious.

[Akane]:
We’ve found Kobato-san! What are you doing right now, Kobato-san?

[Akane]:
It’s a bug! She’s only breathing at me through her nose!

[Akane]:
Ah, that’s Sai-chan’s bento! What kind is it?

Saiki (probably):
Pork.

[Akane]:
And MISA’s?

MISA (probably):
Che-che. (nonsense sound/joke)

☕ Kobato’s Segment

Kobato:
Yes, it’s Kobato’s time, po!
Right now, we’re in the middle of filming the “Bubble” music video.
Kobato has just finished making coffee, po!

Now, let’s go meet the other members, po!
First up—over there! You can see A-chan, po!

Hmm, she’s… groaning? She’s groaning in the massage chair, po!

This is amazing—please give us your review!
The best part, I’d say, is the hand pressure, po!

[Akane]:
There’s no better way to say that?

Kobato:
No, po! The hand pressure!

[Akane]:
It’s like a human is massaging you—warm, lifelike pressure.

Kobato:
A soothing relaxation space, po!

[Akane]:
You’re laughing in a really strange way.

Kobato:
Good work, everyone! What a fantastic performance. Thank you, po!

When Kobato touched your hand, what did you think, po?

[Unknown speaker]:
Hmm… I just thought, “Wow, her hands are tiny.”

Kobato:
So Kobato-san has small hands, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
They were like little cream buns.

[Unknown speaker]:
Hey, people say my hands look like cream buns too!

Kobato:
They really do, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
Try it—see? Same feel, right?

Kobato:
And that concludes our Cream Bun Report, po! (laughs)
I should turn this way so I can see it better, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
Her face is so small! It’s ridiculously tiny—so funny.

[Unknown speaker]:
Which one? Which camera is it?

Kobato:
The big one, po! Yes, that’s perfect—so cool!

[Unknown speaker]:
Why? Doesn’t it look cute? Or creepy? It’s weird.
She looks different from Kobato—kind of scary.
Anyway, we’re done!

That was fun, but it’s freezing now. Please watch it a lot, everyone!

🎤 Final Comment

Kobato:
How was the music video, po?
We did things we don’t normally do—like transformation scenes, po!
It’s packed full of fun moments, and I think it turned out to be a really entertaining music video.

Please watch it again and again,
listen to it over and over,
and keep loving BAND-MAID more and more, po!

Thank you so much, and—
Bye-bye, po!
