🎥 Maid’s Room – Gift from the Band

Saiki:
Masters, hello. It’s Saiki.

Alright—this time too, I’ll be introducing sneakers.
Yes, it’s Nike again.

Today I’ll be showing a pair of Nike sneakers I received as a birthday present from A-chan (Akane), Kanami-chan, and MISA-chan about two or three years ago.

So—here they are.

Once again, they’re Air Force 1s.

These ones were designed, if I remember correctly,
to be a version of the Air Force 1 that’s easy for women to wear—
I think the concept was something like
“Air Force 1 made for women.”

There were several models in that series—
maybe around five or six in total.
The pair I have here is the one I received from the members,
but there are different shapes and variations in the same series,
so I might show one of those another time.

The official name of this sneaker is
Nike Air Force 1 Jester.

Unlike the standard Air Force 1,
the heel is thicker—
a platform sole, basically.

Also, can you see?
The side swoosh logo is slightly shifted,
and even the logo on the heel is offset lower than usual.

It’s lighter too—
a bit easier to wear.

This Jester model was the first version released,
but it must have been really popular,
because they came out with a bunch of color variations later on.

I think a lot of people have probably seen this model before.

There’s an all-white version,
and also ones with bright color combinations—
they were pretty trendy.

Mine—
it’s hard to describe the color.
It’s not exactly white,
but not gray either.
I just thought this color was really cute,
and I like it a lot.

To the members—thank you!
I’m taking good care of them. 👟

Since it’s an Air Force 1 designed for women,
it gives off a more refined and elegant impression
than the usual street-style Air Force 1,
while still keeping that classic look.

They used high-quality leather,
so the shoe feels light and soft,
but still stylish and graceful.

Oh, and besides the box,
it even came with a drawstring pouch—
really cute.

So that’s the pair of sneakers I received from the members.

Bye-bye. 👋
