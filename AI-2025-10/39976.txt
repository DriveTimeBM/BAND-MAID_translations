🎥 Maid’s Room – Kobato Miku’s Movie Recommendation #1

Welcome home, Masters, Princesses, and OMEISYUSAMA!
Kuruppo! It’s Kobato Miku, po! 🕊️

For this very first episode of Maid’s Room,
I, Kobato Miku, together with Torao—
will be bringing you one episode and one bird! Po!

Please take good care of us, po!

Now then, everyone—
how have you all been doing lately, po?
Are you staying safe and sound at home, po?

Torao-san has… well… flown off somewhere for now,
so I’ll be continuing this by myself, po!

Today, during this time together,
I’d like to introduce one of Kobato’s recommended movies, po!

When I write lyrics,
I often watch a lot of films for inspiration—
I draw ideas and emotions from them,
and sometimes those feelings end up in BAND-MAID songs.

That’s why I love watching movies, po!

So, since we’re all spending more time staying home,
I thought it would be wonderful
if Masters and Princesses could also watch
one of Kobato’s favorite films, po!

🎬 Movie Recommendation #1: Shall We Dance? (1996)

Ta-da!
Today’s first recommendation is…
“Shall We Dance?”, po! 👏👏👏👏👏

Shall We Dance? is a Japanese film released in 1996 (Heisei 8).
Do you know it, po?

Some of you might not,
but this film is a heartwarming comedy, po!

However—
I refuse to let anyone call it “just a heartwarming comedy,” po!

When I first saw Shall We Dance? as a little girl,
I thought, “What a wonderful movie, po!”
Since then, I’ve rewatched it so many times
that I lost count, po!

I watched it so much that the videotape actually wore out, po! (laughs)

My mother used to dance ballroom,
so this movie was something we often watched together—
I have such fond memories of that, po!

And above all,
the lead actor Kōji Yakusho is absolutely amazing, po!

There’s a scene in the movie
where he’s at work in his office,
and even though he’s supposed to be doing paperwork,
his feet start moving to the music without him realizing it—

That scene is just so charming, po!
It’s full of joy and quiet passion.

I truly want all of you—
Masters, Princesses, OMEISYUSAMA—
to watch it, po!
It’s a film I want to share with everyone.

Please, please check it out, po!

And that’s all for today’s Maid’s Room!
This was Kobato Miku and Torao, po!

Bye-bye, kuruppo! 🕊️💞
