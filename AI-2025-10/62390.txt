🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (September)

Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanami.

September, of course, means—it’s Mincho’s birthday month, isn’t it?

Can you guess what I’ll be doing for my birthday this year?
Well, this year—actually, again this year—
I’ll be working from home!

Since I can’t really go out much,
I plan to enjoy it by ordering some delicious food to eat at home.

Lastly, my “Song of the Month” is one that blends in a bit of my favorite genre—
a song that reflects something like my personal “hobby” vibe.

The song is “Bubble.”
