🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (July)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

It’s been getting really hot lately, po!
But then suddenly—boom!—there’s heavy rain or thunder,
and it totally catches you off guard, po!

Everyone, please be careful, okay, po?
Your life is the most important thing, po!

Even as I’m recording this, there’s thunder rumbling outside, po!

So for this month’s song, I chose one
that gives you the strength to not lose to even the fiercest rain or thunder—
“Screaming,” po!

Thank you for listening, po!
