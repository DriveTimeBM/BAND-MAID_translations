🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (January 2022)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

This month’s song is one that makes you feel warm instead of cold—
a song that can heat you up, po!
It’s “Hibana,” po!

The photo is of simmered daikon radish,
which Kobato always feels like making on chilly nights, po.
I simmer it with umeboshi (pickled plum) too—it’s so good, po!

Even when my stomach feels a bit off,
eating this makes me feel refreshed, po.

So, everyone—let’s all do our best not to lose to the cold, po!

Bye-bye~kuruppo~!
