## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ MISA (4 of 10)

**MISA:**
Hello, itâ€™s MISA. Howâ€™s everyone doing? Iâ€™m doing great.

This time, Iâ€™ll be introducing our drummer, **Akane**.

By nature, Iâ€™m the type of person who tends to be considerate of others,  
but when Iâ€™m with Akane, itâ€™s strangeâ€”I can just **relax and be myself**.  

I think thatâ€™s because of her personalityâ€”she has such a warm and easygoing nature.  
Being around her feels so comfortable.  

We often laugh together over the most **ridiculous little things**,  
and sheâ€™s truly a fun and kind-hearted girl.  

Akane, letâ€™s keep being the **best rhythm team** together!  

Thatâ€™s all from MISA.
