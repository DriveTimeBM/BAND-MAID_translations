💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – Saiki (3 of 4)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. It’s Saiki.

Thank you for the question!

This time, I was asked:
“What advice or tips would you give to someone who’s just starting to sing?”

I think the most important thing when singing is to enjoy it.

If you start learning piano along with singing,
it’ll help you understand pitch and key more accurately—
and it’s a lot of fun, too.
