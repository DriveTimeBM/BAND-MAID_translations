🎥 Akane & Saiki

Saiki:
It’s Saiki.

Akane:
And Akane.

Saiki:
We’re suddenly starting like this! (laughs)
Usually you’d say something like, “Hi there,” right? Anyway—Saiki.

Akane:
Akane. Today it’s just the two of us talking.

You don’t often see the vocalist and drummer paired up like this.
It’s rare, right?

Saiki:
Yeah, definitely rare. You don’t see that much anywhere.

Akane:
Exactly! But actually, I’ve always thought this combination was really interesting—
since drums create the rhythm and the vocals carry the melody,
we’re both part of the foundation of a song.
So I was really looking forward to this talk.

Saiki:
(laughs) I was too.

Akane:
Liar.

Saiki:
No, I really was! You just said it in a way that sounds fake. (laughs)

Anyway, here’s what I’ve been wondering—
as a vocalist, what kind of environment feels easiest to sing in?
Like, what makes it comfortable or difficult for you?
Is it about the monitor mix, or the groove of the rhythm section?

There’s got to be both—some things make it easy, others not so much.

Saiki:
Yeah, for sure. It really depends.

Akane:
Every band probably has a different balance.
So from your point of view,
what kind of drum sound or rhythm makes it easier to sing?
Is it the monitor mix? Or the way the groove locks in?
What makes the perfect environment for you to sing in?

Saiki:
Hmm… when have I felt that?

Let’s see—
for me, in BAND-MAID, I absolutely can’t sing unless I can hear A-chan (Akane) clearly behind me.

Akane:
Ah, the drums!

Saiki:
Yeah. There are so many BAND-MAID songs where my vocal phrasing fits directly with your drum rhythm.
If I can’t hear you, it becomes really hard to sing.

So when you’re not there—or I can’t hear you clearly—it’s tough.

When it comes to stage sound, my monitor mix might be a little different from everyone else’s,
but as long as I can feel the sound through my body, I’m fine.

Akane:
I see. But yeah, we’re definitely a loud band.

Saiki:
So loud! (laughs)
BAND-MAID’s stage volume—our monitor sound—is huge.

For anyone who doesn’t know,
“monitor sound” is what we hear on stage,
while the “front sound” is what the audience hears.

We’ve been told so many times that BAND-MAID’s stage volume is massive.

Akane:
Yeah, our onstage sound is really big.

Saiki:
That’s why I only half-seal my in-ear monitors (IEMs).
If I sealed them completely, I couldn’t hear anyone else—
so I leave them slightly open to still catch the band’s live sound.

Then, I have my own voice fed back louder into my ears
so I can hear myself clearly even with all that volume around me.

Akane:
Ahh, so that’s how it works for you.

Saiki:
Right. Even if the pitch drifts a little or a hand slips on an instrument,
I just lock into that rhythm.
But yeah, with how loud the monitors are,
it’s amazing we can even perform at all sometimes. (laughs)

Akane:
Seriously! I always think, “How does she even sing in that?”

For people who don’t know — we all wear in-ear monitors,
like little earphones that let you hear your own mix during a live show.

Saiki:
Yeah.

Akane:
But Saiki uses a different kind—the canal type that hooks around your ear—
not the custom-molded ones like the rest of us use.

Saiki:
Right. I can’t use molded ones.

Akane:
Oh?

Saiki:
Yeah, when I tried making ear molds, I realized—
when you close off your mouth, nose, and ears,
your voice actually changes because all the airways are sealed.
So it affects how I hear myself.

That’s why it doesn’t work for me.

Akane:
Ah, that makes sense.

Saiki:
I rely a lot on bone conduction to hear my own voice—
that’s how I match pitch.

Akane:
Bone conduction, huh? That’s interesting.

Saiki:
Yeah, the sound I hear in my head through vibrations
is different from the one that comes through the mic and speakers,
so if I completely block my ears, my pitch sense changes.

Akane:
That’s fascinating.

Saiki:
Some singers can handle full-mold IEMs fine,
but for me, that difference throws me off.
So now I use ones that have tiny vents—
I can close or open them depending on whether I want more outside sound.

That way, I can still hear the stage air and catch subtle things like
the breath right before someone sings or plays—
that kind of unmic’d air that only happens live.

Akane:
Yeah, I totally get that.
If you don’t have that atmosphere, it feels off.

Saiki:
Exactly.

Akane:
At first, using IEMs felt weird, right?
It’s like you’re suddenly alone.
I think it took everyone a few years to get used to.

Saiki:
Totally. It used to feel isolating.

Akane:
Yeah. We’d all be like, “It’s too loud!” or “Turn it down!” (laughs)
But now it’s just part of how we play.

Saiki:
Right, every band has their quirks.
Ours is definitely volume. (laughs)

Akane:
(laughs) True!
But that’s what makes us BAND-MAID.

And speaking of rhythm—
recently we’ve been doing dance lessons once a month, right?

Saiki:
Yeah, the “Beginner Dance Club”!

Akane:
Exactly! My childhood friend is a dancer,
so we started this Beginner Dance Club and Saiki joined.

Saiki:
It’s so fun, but also hard!
But it really improves your rhythm sense.

Akane:
I always say this, but your rhythm sense is incredible.

Saiki:
Thanks. Honestly, I’m glad I started dancing—
it’s helped a lot with rhythm.

Akane:
Yeah, the difference between people who’ve done dance and those who haven’t is huge.
Especially in how they understand syncopation and off-beats.

Saiki:
Right, like how in dance you count “1 & 2 & 3 & 4,”
so you naturally learn to feel the “&”—the offbeat—
whereas in music, we might think of that as “upbeats.”

Akane:
Exactly! So in dance it’s the “&,”
but in music it’s “up” or “off-beat.”
They’re the same thing, just different language.

Saiki:
It’s so interesting how it connects.

Akane:
Yeah! The rhythm sense overlaps perfectly between dance and music.
That’s why I joined the dance club too—to strengthen my sense of timing.

Saiki:
Same here.
It really trains your body to link with rhythm.

Akane:
It’s tough, but fun. Let’s keep at it!

Saiki:
Yeah, let’s keep improving—
for both dancing and drumming and singing.

Akane:
Alright, that’s it for today. Thanks for watching!

Saiki:
Bye-bye! 👋
