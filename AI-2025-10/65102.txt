🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (November)

Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho.

Can you guess what my “Song of the Month” is?
Here’s a hint: it’s a song I wrote while thinking,
“Music should be free.”

The answer is—“NO GOD.”

I’m truly grateful to be able to do BAND-MAID
in such a fun, free way.

The photo I’m sharing this time is of cream puffs
I made for the first time in a long while, about a month ago.
I love sweets!

That’s all for now—see you next time!
