🎥 Maid’s Room – Fire Red Jordans

Saiki:
Hello, it’s Saiki.

Masters, how are you doing?
Sai-chan’s doing great.

Since this is Maid’s Room for our Masters,
I thought I’d talk a bit about something I love —
sneakers. 👟

So today, I’ll be talking about a pair I recently got.
Please stick with me until the end.

Alright, here they are.

Many of you can probably tell just by looking—
these are Air Jordans.

The Jumpman logo—you know, that famous pose
where former NBA player Michael Jordan is going up for a dunk—
it’s iconic, right?

Even if you’re not into sneakers,
you’ve probably seen it somewhere before.

This pair is from the Jordan series—
can you see it?
It’s the Air Jordan 5 Retro OG.

I got mine in GS size (the girls’ size),
and the color is called Fire Red. 🔥

I actually won these through a lottery,
which made me super happy!

When I was trying to buy them,
I even had all the members help me enter every possible lottery.
On release day, they all got up at 9 a.m.
to help with the SNKRS app entries too.

Thankfully, I managed to win with my own entry,
so—yay! [claps]

I’m really grateful to the members
for always helping me out.
Thank you so much.

This version is actually a reissue.
It was brought back for the 30th anniversary of the original release.

The last time it was reissued was about seven years ago,
around the time we first started BAND-MAID.

Back then, I wasn’t really into Jordans yet—
I was more of an Air Max fan.
I didn’t know much about them at the time.

It was only about three years ago
that I learned about this specific model.
And ever since then,
I’ve wanted them so badly it hurt.

But they were impossible to find—
either my size wasn’t available,
or they weren’t new,
and if they were… they were crazy expensive because of resale prices.

So yeah, it wasn’t easy to get them.

But then in 2020,
they finally reissued them again—
and I was like, “I’ve been waiting for this!”

I finally got them.

Aren’t they beautiful from every angle?
Just look at how cute they are—
even the back looks great.

So that’s it for today.
I just wanted to share one of my favorite sneakers.

See you next time.
Bye-bye. 👋
