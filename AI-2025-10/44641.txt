🎥 Akane’s Maid’s Room – Favorite Scent Items

Akane:
Hello, Masters and Princesses! It’s Akane! 💐

So—this might sound sudden, but…
I’m really into scents!
Yes, I’m a total scent lover!

I’ve collected tons of good-smelling items over the years,
and today I want to introduce some of my favorites to you, my OMEISYUSAMA!

Alright, let’s get started!

🍷 1. MODERN NOTES “Wine Collection” Diffuser – Rose Wine Scent

This first one is the MODERN NOTES Wine Collection diffuser, in Rose Wine.

It’s sweet but also light and refreshing — such a lovely scent!
I actually got this one as a birthday gift,
and what’s amazing is that the fragrance lasts for months!

I love it so much that I keep repurchasing it again and again.

🌸 2. LAEISYS Toner & Emulsion (by makeup artist Yuri Miyamoto)

Next are these: LAEISYS toner and emulsion.

They were produced by my good friend, the hair and makeup artist Yuri Miyamoto.

These smell so good!
They have a floral scent that just melts your heart.

Even when I’m not using them,
I sometimes open the cap just to sniff them—
that’s how much I love this scent! (laughs)

But not only do they smell nice—
they also make your skin soft and glowy.
The ultimate toner and emulsion combo!

By the way, MISA and Kanami use these too!
Highly recommended for men as well.

💗 3. MILBON Jemile Fran “Melty Butter Balm”

Next up—this one!

It’s the Melty Butter Balm by Milbon Jemile Fran.

It’s a hair treatment,
but you can also use it as a hand cream—super convenient!

The hairstylist used this on me during the shoot for our Start Over music video.

Actually, this scent is MISA’s favorite!
During the shoot, I was the only one who had this product in my hair,
so every time I passed by MISA on set,
she’d lean in and sniff my hair! 😂

So of course, I bought one for myself—
for MISA’s sake!
I still use it all the time.

I call it my “MISA Trap.”
It’s a very sweet scent!

🍐 4. Jo Malone Room Spray – English Pear & Freesia

Next is this luxurious item:
Jo Malone’s English Pear & Freesia room spray.

This was a birthday present from Haruko-chan,
the vocalist of Ryokushaka!

In my mind, “Jo Malone is what classy women use.”
And since Haruko-chan gifted it to me—
that makes her a classy woman too!

The scent is just… so elegant.
Ahhh, so nice!
It smells like a sophisticated woman!

Now I can be a classy woman too—thank you, Haruko-chan! 💐

🌼 5. JILL STUART Hair Mist & Hand Cream – White Floral

Next, a classic for girls everywhere:
JILL STUART Treatment Hair Mist in White Floral!

When you think of JILL STUART,
you think of that White Floral scent, right?

Everyone loves this smell—it’s perfection.
Floral is justice! ✨

And this is the matching hand cream—also White Floral.
All of JILL’s cosmetics smell amazing.

I also have their lip treatment balm—
the one you apply to your lips.

All of these were birthday gifts from friends!
Everyone always gives me something that smells good—
I’m so grateful. Thank you, my friends! 💖

🌿 6. AROMIC STYLE 100% Natural Aroma Sprays

Now for my aromatherapy corner!
These are AROMIC STYLE natural aroma sprays — I have a few types.

Let’s start with the Daytime one.
It contains rosemary camphor and lemon essential oils.

It’s such a refreshing scent —
I spray it in my room every morning when I wake up to help me feel alert.

I also use it when I’m writing music sheets,
or when I need a change of mood while practicing drums.
It’s perfect for refreshing your mind!

Then there’s the Nighttime version.
This one has lavender and sweet orange essential oils —
great for relaxation.
I spray it before going to bed every night.

And here’s the Anti-Bacteria version —
super useful!
It’s made with six essential oils with antibacterial and antiviral effects (I read that on their website!).

It has a gentle herbal scent,
so it’s easy for men to use as well.

🍊 7. KITOKA Natural Diffuser

Still on the aromatherapy theme —
this one’s from a different brand called KITOKA.

It’s a 100% natural essential oil diffuser —
you just leave it in your room.

It traps the scent of nature itself,
so it smells wonderfully gentle and organic.

I think this one was Mandarin Orange.

Oh, by the way — I actually have a Level 1 Aromatherapy Certification!
I don’t use it for work or anything,
but a while back, I got really into aromatherapy,
studied all about essential oils and their properties,
and passed the exam!

Maybe one day, my Aromatherapy Level 1 license will come in handy…
Hopefully! (laughs)

🩵 8. SHIRO – Sabon Series (The All-Time Favorite)

And finally…
my number one, all-time favorite brand — SHIRO!

I absolutely love their Sabon scent.
I’ve been using it for years!

They recently renewed their packaging —
here’s the old version,
and this is the new one.

I have the whole set in Sabon scent:

Diffuser (for the room)

Body oil

Perfume

Body cologne

And that’s not even all —
SHIRO has so many Sabon-scented products:
hair oil, treatment, hand cream, fabric softener, body wash…
So many!

My dream is to one day have everything in SHIRO Sabon!

💬 Closing Message

So, how was it?
Those were all my favorite “good smell” items!

If you have any scent recommendations—
something that smells amazing or that you love—
please tell me!

I’ll buy it immediately. 😂

This was Akane, your scent-loving maid!
Bye-bye! 👋
