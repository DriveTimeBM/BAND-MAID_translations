Hello, Masters and Princesses. Itâ€™s Saiki.

My recommended way to spend time at home is to sing, watch movies,
or just do things that I personally enjoy.

A movie I watched recently that I found especially interesting was
The Grand Budapest Hotel.

If you havenâ€™t seen it yet, Masters and Princesses,
please check it out!
