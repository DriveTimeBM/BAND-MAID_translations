🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (February 2022)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

How are you all doing?

For this month’s song, I chose “about Us.”

February felt especially cold,
so I went with a song that can warm the heart.

Please give it a listen.

The photo is of some dried flowers I made recently—
I thought I’d share that with you.
