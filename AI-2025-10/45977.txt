🎥 Maid’s Room – Karaage Cooking

MISA:
Hello, it’s MISA.

Since this is the fifth video,
I thought I’d do another cooking video for the first time in a while.

Today, I’m making karaage (Japanese fried chicken).

First, I’m going to have a drink.
Itadakimasu. 🍺

For today, I’ve prepared chicken thigh and gizzards.

I’ll start coating the meat with potato starch.
No seasoning today.
Just like this—covering it with potato starch.

Alright, now I’ll start frying.

That sound—
can you hear it?
Nice sound.

Pure white.

Switching pieces.
Still pure white.
Looks beautiful.

Now I’ll fry the gizzards.
Good sound.

I’m using an iron frying pan this time,
so I feel like it’ll fry up really well.

It’s done!

I’ve added grated daikon and ponzu.
That’s gizzards and thigh meat.

Alright, time to eat.

Let’s see if you can hear the sound.
Delicious.
Perfect.

Now I’ll set that aside and try the gizzards.
Can you hear it?
Delicious.

Okay, everyone—please try making this too.

See you.

✅ Notes:

MISA uses karaage (fried chicken) with both chicken thigh and gizzards (sunagimo/しなぎも).

Seasoning: none; only potato starch coating.

Dipping sauce: grated daikon with ponzu.

Tone: quiet, simple, direct — relaxed and content, as in her previous cooking videos.
