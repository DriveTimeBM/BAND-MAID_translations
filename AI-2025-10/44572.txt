💬 Voice Message to Fan Club Members – MISA (3 of 4)

MISA:
Hello, it’s MISA.

This question is from Tetsu-san:
“What concert has left you with the best memories?”

It was probably right after I joined BAND-MAID—
I went to see Blur’s Japan show.

At that time, I was a huge fan who knew almost every song,
so I had an absolutely amazing time.

It left such a strong impression on me;
I’ll never forget the shock and excitement I felt that day.

Now I feel like checking out some Blur songs again.
If you haven’t listened to them before, definitely give them a try!

Thanks for the question. Bye-bye!
