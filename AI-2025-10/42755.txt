## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Akane (7 of 10)

**Akane:**
Hello, Masters and Princesses! Itâ€™s Akane.

Today Iâ€™ll be introducing **MISA**!  

Sheâ€™s my **ultimate rhythm partner**â€”weâ€™re the strongest duo when it comes to rhythm.  
Our sense of humor totally matches, so weâ€™re always laughing over the silliest things.  

She might *look* cool on the outside, but sheâ€™s actually not cool at allâ€”  
among all the members, sheâ€™s the most **girly** one!  

Whenever I visit MISAâ€™s house, she always cooks up so many delicious dishes.  
So lately Iâ€™ve been thinkingâ€¦ maybe I should just move in with her! (laughs)  

Thatâ€™s all from Akane. Bye-bye!
