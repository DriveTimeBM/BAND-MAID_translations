## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Kanami (1 of 10)

**Kanami:**
Hello, Masters and Princesses! How are you?  
This is Kanami on guitar.

Lately, I’ve been spending my days at home doing nothing but **practice and songwriting**.  

Whenever I work on composing, I always keep **snacks nearby**,  
but recently, I ran out of everything in the house!  

So I thought, *“If there are no snacks, I’ll just make them myself!”*  

For the first time in years, I baked some **madeleines**, and they turned out *so delicious*!  
A happy ending indeed.  

See you next time!
