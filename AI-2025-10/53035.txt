🎬 BAND-MAID – “After Life” MV: Behind the Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
Please tell us your favorite food!
It’s strawberries, right? It’s always strawberries.
Why not something like ayu (sweetfish)? That’d sound cooler.
You like ayu, right?

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah—write it like ayu the singer, like Hamasaki Ayumi.

[Unknown speaker]:
Wait, how do you write ayu in kanji again? It’s “fish” with “fortune-telling,” right?

[Unknown speaker]:
That’s it! Okay then—it’s ayu!

If you want to know more about the members’ profiles,
send in your questions anytime—bye-bye!

💍 The “Wedding Scene” Skit

[Unknown speaker]:
Now, we’ll begin the wedding ceremony for the newlyweds—Saiki-san and Akane-san!

[Unknown speaker]:
Wait, that’s reversed! It’s bride Saiki and groom Akane!

[Unknown speaker]:
Bride Saiki, do you swear to love your partner forever?

[Unknown speaker]:
Hold on, Sai-chan, you weren’t supposed to listen to that part!

[Unknown speaker]:
Name? What’s your name?

[Unknown speaker]:
Saiki!

[Unknown speaker]:
Alright then, Saiki—what will you do?

[Unknown speaker]:
How will you decide? We’re before the gods, po.
You must choose one person to marry, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
Don’t blow out the candle!

[Unknown speaker]:
I don’t want either! (laughs)

[Unknown speaker]:
Then bride Kanami—

[Unknown speaker]:
“Beautiful Saiki! Beautiful Saiki!”

[Unknown speaker]:
Akane, do you swear eternal love?

[Unknown speaker]:
Do you swear it, po?

[Unknown speaker]:
Really, is it okay for it to be me? You don’t secretly love someone else, do you?

[Unknown speaker]:
I know who you truly love.

[Unknown speaker]:
Who is it?!

[Unknown speaker]:
Bride Akane—do you swear to live and love on your own?

[Unknown speaker]:
Yes. I’ll live on my own—strongly.

[Unknown speaker]:
Strongest! Great work today!

🎥 Comments on Filming

[Kanami]:
There were lots of staff and extras this time.
We filmed mostly in the hallway and darker backgrounds—
it was our first time filming in a school-like hallway setting.

We had to be really careful not to bump into each other,
but still play with intensity.
I hope you’ll enjoy it!

[MISA]:
Good work, everyone!
The smoke machines were really fun to use!
The whole shoot was so much fun—please look forward to the finished video!

That’s a wrap!

[Akane]:
This time, for BAND-MAID, it was rare—
there were other maids appearing too, not just us!
Of course, we went full rock,
but there are also cute choreography parts,
so please look forward to that! Bye-bye!

☁️ Kobato’s Comment

Kobato:
Kuruppo! It’s Kobato, po!
Today we filmed the MV for After Life, po!

Kobato’s scenes are all finished, po!
We used smoke effects and filmed in a style that feels a little different
from what we’ve done before.

I think it’s going to be a really beautiful and emotional music video, po!
I hope our Masters and Princesses will love it even more after watching, po!

Kobato is really looking forward to seeing the completed version, po!
Please enjoy! Kobato out, po!

[Saiki]:
Good work, everyone!
The After Life MV shoot is complete.
This was the first time we had other maids appear alongside us,
so it’s going to be something unique and fun to watch.

Have you seen it yet?
Please watch it lots and lots!
See you again next time! Bye-bye!
