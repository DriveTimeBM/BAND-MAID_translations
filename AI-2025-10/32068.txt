🎬 BAND-MAID – “Endless Story” MV: Behind the Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
This is going to be grand! Like an epic scene!
Alright everyone, let’s go on a picnic!

[Unknown speaker]:
We’re back—please be careful on your way!

🌊 At the Beach

[Unknown speaker]:
This is our second time filming at the ocean,
but it feels completely different from last time.
I’m really looking forward to it—it fits the song perfectly.
Let’s do our best!

[Unknown speaker]:
What’s “the heartbeat of the waves”?

[Unknown speaker]:
The heartbeat of the waves? What does that even mean?

[Unknown speaker]:
Like, if the sea had feelings—it’s alive, right? That’s the heartbeat.

[Unknown speaker]:
As expected from A-chan! (laughs)

☀️ Filming on Oshima Island

[Unknown speaker]:
Yes, today we’re on Oshima Island, with Kaigai Saiki-sensei!
We’ve been working hard since early morning.

[Unknown speaker]:
Did the number of people here increase?

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah, it went up—now there are four!

[Unknown speaker]:
Still, there’s a weird distance between us and the spectators.

[Unknown speaker]:
If there were kids around, the crows would snatch them!

[Unknown speaker]:
(laughs) The crows would take them away!

🏝️ Day 2 of Shooting

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s the second day of filming!

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s huge here.

[Unknown speaker]:
Day 2! It doesn’t even feel like Japan.
If someone told me this was Australia, I’d totally believe it.

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah, same. “Where am I? Who am I?” kind of feeling.

[Unknown speaker]:
Let’s do our best!

🦟 The Bug Follows

[Unknown speaker]:
Ah—there’s a bug!

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s been following me this whole time!

[Unknown speaker]:
Maybe because you’re wearing white—it’s attracted to you?

[Unknown speaker]:
Do bugs really go for white clothes here?

☀️ Relaxation & Massage Segment

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s already bright enough out here!

[Unknown speaker]:
Right around here, maybe?

[Unknown speaker]:
Feels great.

[Unknown speaker]:
I love it.

[Unknown speaker]:
Now I’m loosening up the shoulder blades.
We’ll start by relaxing the tension in your back,
then move the shoulders so everything’s more flexible.

Since the front muscles are also tight,
we’ll soften them up too.
Looks like your back is tired from drumming!

Take time to let go of everyday stress.

[Unknown speaker]:
That face was definitely one of despair.

[Unknown speaker]:
She’s not even breathing!

[Unknown speaker]:
We’re connecting the lower and upper muscles—working on the big group here.

[Unknown speaker]:
Proper warm-up is important!
If you stretch too suddenly, you’ll hurt yourself.
Do it slowly, within what your body allows.

[Unknown speaker]:
Your right shoulder’s really stiff—
must be from carrying that heavy bass all the time.

[Unknown speaker]:
This part, yeah.
At least your upper arm’s all soft and squishy.

🌅 Closing Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
Cool!

[Unknown speaker]:
Whoa, that was close—

[Unknown speaker]:
Why’d you yell like that?

[Unknown speaker]:
Because you almost fell!

[Unknown speaker]:
It suddenly went quiet—it’s like everyone froze. (laughs)

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s definitely going to turn out as a beautiful video.

[Unknown speaker]:
And now, Saiki-sensei has safely survived, po!
Now it’s time to head back to Tokyo, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
Thank you very much, po!

[All (in closing)]:
Thank you for your hard work!
Good job, everyone!
Goodbye!
