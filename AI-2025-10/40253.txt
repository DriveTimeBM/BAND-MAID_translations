## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Kanami (2 of 10)

**Kanami:**
Hello, itâ€™s Kanami on guitar.

Today Iâ€™d like to introduce **Kobato**!  

Kobato is very honest and truly, truly adorable.  
Sheâ€™s a hardworking person who handles **guitar, vocals, and songwriting**.  

However, sheâ€™s always scary when she wakes up.  
Her sleeping face always looks like sheâ€™s suffering! (laughs)  

Every Valentineâ€™s Day, she usually makes something for all the members,  
but this year, she didnâ€™t make anything for us.  

Please make something next time, okay?  

Thatâ€™s all for today. See you next time!
