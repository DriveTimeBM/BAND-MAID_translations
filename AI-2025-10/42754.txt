ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Saiki (3 of 10)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. Itâ€™s Saiki.

This time, Iâ€™ll be introducing MISA.

On the outside, she gives off a total cool beauty vibe,
but when she smiles, sheâ€™s incredibly cuteâ€”
Iâ€™m sure there are many Masters who love her dimples, right?

More than anything, sheâ€™s rock through and throughâ€”
she loves music and she loves alcohol,
and sheâ€™s a bassist I truly respect from the heart.

Thatâ€™s all from Saiki.
