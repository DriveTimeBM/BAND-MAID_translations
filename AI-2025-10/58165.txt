🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (June)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

This month’s “Song of the Month” is—
well, since it’s June, it’s Father’s Day, isn’t it?

So, I’ll go with “BIG DAD.”

It’s mainly Kobato’s song, but since she didn’t pick it herself,
I figured she wasn’t really feeling it this month,
so Sai-chan chose it on her behalf.

Please give it a listen. Bye-bye.
