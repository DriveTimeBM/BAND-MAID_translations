🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (January 2022)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

How are you all doing?

For this month’s “Song of the Month,”
I chose “Anemone.”

The reason is simply because
I’ve been listening to it a lot lately.

Everyone, please give it a listen too.

This is unrelated, but recently
Sai-chan has been growing hyacinths.
Please take a look at the photo.

Goodbye.
