🎥 Kanami’s Room – Homemade Banana Cake

Kanami:
Masters and Princesses, how are you doing?
This is Kanamincho. 🌸

In my last video, I shared how I make coffee by hand-drip.
Did you see it? ☕

In a recent voice message, I mentioned that I had made some Madeleines —
but today, I went ahead and made… banana cake! 🍌

Ta-dah!

Let me bring it over—
Here it is!

Look at that—
It baked beautifully, didn’t it?

Alright, let’s cut it and give it a try.

There we go… banana cake, complete!

Now then, let’s taste it.

Mmm… it’s delicious!

This one is made using my mother’s secret recipe —
she taught me exactly how to make it.
So it really tastes like my mom’s home cooking.
So good!

Recently, I haven’t been able to see the other members very much,
and I haven’t had many chances to talk with people either—
so I feel like I’m getting worse and worse at speaking. (laughs softly)

But even so, I’ve been doing fun rehearsals and songwriting
over video calls with the members.

And that’s all for today.
Thank you for watching! 💖

☕ Fan Notes

Tone: Soft, homely, warm — Kanami speaks like she’s sitting across the table from you.

Madeleine reference: Connects to her previous “voice letter” (audio message) to OMEISYUSAMA.

“Mother’s secret recipe”: Very typical of Kanami’s personality — humble and sentimental.

Comment about talking less: Reflects her natural shyness and quiet personality, but also her genuine bond with the band.

Ending: Simple, understated — she always ends on a gentle, “that’s all for today,” like a friendly check-in.
