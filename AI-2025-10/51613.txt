## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Kanami (9 of 10)

**Kanami:**
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho!

Here’s a behind-the-scenes story from **“Unseen World.”**  

By the time I finished working on the album, I had actually **lost 5 kilograms**!  
But don’t worry—it’s all come back now, so I’m perfectly fine. (laughs)  

Creating an album really does feel a bit like **giving birth**, doesn’t it?  

So, I hope that all of you will listen to these songs—our precious creations—  
and love them, cherish them, and help them grow.  

That would make me truly happy.  
Thank you!
