## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Akane (5 of 10)

**Akane:**
Hello, it’s Akane!

Here’s a behind-the-scenes story from the making of **“Sensei World.”**  
During the time from production through recording,  
my **arm and leg muscles** got seriously stronger!  

Well, of course they did—these songs are all so fast!  
“Black Hole,” for example, has a tempo of **220 BPM**—  
the fastest in BAND-MAID history!  

I’m sure that Kanami’s songs will keep making me even more muscular from here on out.  
Please look forward to it!
