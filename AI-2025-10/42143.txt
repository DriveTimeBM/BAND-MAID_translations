🎥 Kanami’s Room – Talking About Saiki

Kanami:
Hello, everyone. How are you enjoying things?
It’s Kanami.

In the first episode of Maid’s Room, I did a video of myself making coffee.
In the second, I just ate banana cake, because I wanted to show everyone that I really love sweets.

And now, this is the third episode.

I thought about what to do this time,
and since a lot of you already know what I like or what my hobbies are,
I decided to introduce something very dear to me.

First, please take a look at this picture.

Are you looking?
Yes — this is Sai-chan.

I think at this point it’s not just that I like Saiki,
or that I’m a fan —
it’s basically become one of my hobbies. (laughs)

So today, I’d like to talk a little about Sai-chan,
here in Kanami’s Room.

Here’s another photo —
this one’s of Sai-chan during an Okyuji (live performance).

During Okyuji, Sai-chan has this incredible energy
that draws people in,
and she delivers such powerful singing and performance.
She’s a truly amazing vocalist.

But offstage,
she also has this very gentle and kind side.

Of course, she can be strict at times,
and she really leads us with strong leadership —
she’s so cool —
but she’s also genuinely kind.

She’s especially kind to Mincho (that’s me). (laughs)
I really love her.

Alright, let’s move on to the next photo.

Here it is — isn’t this one cute?

I really like the character Coji-Coji,
and there’s this figure of Yakan-kun (the kettle character)
that I saw in a crane game machine,
and I was saying, “Ah, I want it so bad, I want it!”

Then suddenly, I got a message from Sai-chan saying,

“I got it!”

I was like, “Eh? What do you mean?”
And when I asked,
she said that during some downtime between work,
she had gone into a game center
and actually won Yakan-kun from the crane game for me.

When I heard that, I thought,
“Ahh, Sai-chan is so kind… I love her.”

It’s such a cute picture.
I’m looking at it on my computer right now,
and—yeah, she’s just adorable.
That face—so cute.

Next photo—
this one is from my birthday.

A few years ago,
Sai-chan gave me a very special present:
a hug. 💞

She came up to me and hugged me,
and that’s when this picture was taken.

It was such an emotional moment—
even now when I think about it,
I could cry.

I think maybe even some of our Masters and Princesses
might have shed tears seeing it, too.

…No? No one? (laughs)
Okay, sorry.

Sai-chan is cool and stylish,
and some people might think she’s a bit scary,
but she’s actually very kind,
and strong-willed at her core.

She’s such a wonderful person—
someone everyone ends up loving.

I think that’s about all the time I have today,
so I’ll stop here.

Thank you for listening to me talk about Sai-chan.

That’s all for today.
Bye-bye! 👋

✅ Notes:

Tone: Warm, admiring, heartfelt, with Kanami’s typical sweet humor.

Key themes: Gratitude, friendship, Saiki’s dual image — strong on stage, gentle off stage.
