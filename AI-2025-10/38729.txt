🎬 BAND-MAID – “The Dragon Cries” MV: Behind the Scenes

[Unknown speaker]:
Is it okay to stand here? Like this much?

Kobato (Speaker 1):
Yes, po! Look this way, po! Look!
Alright, I’ll do my best—fired up, po!
Hmm, what’s this, po? This story’s taking on a life of its own, po!
Facing A-chan like this—this is actually the first time we’ve filmed something where we all really look at each other directly.

I’m not entirely sure about the setting yet,
but I think it’s shaping up nicely—starting from that guitar riff.
It’s got this melancholic, emotional atmosphere,
but in a good way—it feels mysterious.
It’s that kind of vibe that MISA loves, po!

MISA (off-camera):
Yeah, this one’s my favorite kind of thing.

Kobato:
Right, po!

Everyone—great work today!
This was the filming for “THE DRAGON CRIES” music video,
and it was a completely new, immersive world for us—
something we’ve never done before.

It was a lot of fun to shoot,
and I’m really looking forward to seeing how it turns out!

Let’s all watch it together, many times, po!
Bye-bye, po! 👋

Video: The Dragon Cries MV – Behind the Scenes

Theme:

Filming felt different from usual—focused and atmospheric.

Kobato notes the emotional, slightly eerie tone of the visuals.

The atmosphere matched the song’s melancholic and mysterious sound.
