## 🎁 BAND-MAID Christmas Gift Exchange – 2020

**Kobato (acting as MC):**  
Alright! First up is MISA-chan. Let’s spin the roulette!  
Ready… spin it! Just a light press. *Click—spin!*  

**Saiki:**  
Oh, she’s making it spin herself!  

**Akane:**  
Whoa, nice!  

**Kanami:**  
Ah, I see! That’s how it works!  

**Kobato:**  
So if you land on yourself, maybe just skip your own name and spin again, po.  
Right—if it lands on you, just remove yourself from the list and go again.  
Got it? MISA-chan, press start!  
*Deden!*  
*Deden!* Waaah! Oh no, this is intense!  

**Saiki:**  
This is kind of nerve-racking!  

**Kanami:**  
Ahhh!  

**Kobato:**  
Akane’s present! Yay! Poi-poi!  

**Akane:**  
So… should I hand it over and we open it now?  

**Kobato:**  
Should MISA open it?  

**Akane:**  
Yeah, go ahead. Let’s open it!  

**Kanami:**  
Ooh, I want to see what’s inside!  

**Akane:**  
It’s a super-powerful **lifting face mask**—it might erase your whole face! (laughs)  

**Kobato:**  
Eh?! Wow!  

**Saiki:**  
It’s seriously strong. I don’t know if my money can handle it.  

**Kobato:**  
My face might disappear too, po!  

**Saiki:**  
You can give it to me later.  

**Kobato:**  
Alright! Next is Kobato, po! Here we go!  
I’ve removed Akane’s name, po. Ready—go!  

Eh—Saiki!  

**Saiki:**  
Yes!  

**Kobato:**  
I thought it might land on me! Yay!  

It’s a **face mask**, po. I’ll open it later, po. Thank you, po!  

**Saiki:**  
Too bad, huh? Thank you!  

**Kobato:**  
Sorry, Kanami-chan! Is trading allowed?  

**Saiki:**  
Negotiations?  

**Kobato:**  
Maybe?  

**Saiki:**  
If anyone wants super-lifted skin—yeah, time for negotiations.  

**Akane:**  
That defeats the purpose of the roulette!  

**Kanami:**  
No trading! But after we see what’s inside, we’ll take photos for memory.  

**Kobato:**  
Right! Okay, next—Kanami-chan!  

**Kanami:**  
Oh! It’s from MISA-chan! She said she thought about it for two hours!  

**MISA:**  
Yeah, I really did, po. Thank you! It’s a **kitchen item**!  

**Saiki:**  
Nice! I love kitchen stuff. Okay, so Saiki’s the last one to spin?  

**Kobato:**  
Right, it’s up to Saiki, po. Go ahead!  

**Saiki:**  
Okay… spinning… *click click click*  

**Kanami:**  
So cute!  

**Kobato:**  
It landed on Kanami’s, po! All done!  

**Kanami:**  
Yay! Though the bag’s a little different, but that’s fine.  

**Kobato:**  
When you open it, it’ll be a surprise!  

**Akane:**  
Now it’s my turn! Who will it be?  

**Kobato:**  
Who could it be, po? Okay, start!  

**Saiki:**  
Who will it be?  

**Kobato:**  
Thank you! Oh, it’s huge! There’s a **heat pack** inside.  
Wait—it’s already used! It’s still warm!  

**Saiki:**  
One by one, let’s open the presents. MISA first.  

**Kobato:**  
MISA first, po!  

**Saiki:**  
It’s a **lifting mask** and… oh! Kanami knows this—**bath salts made with rock salt**!  

**Kobato:**  
Wow! A bath item and a face pack!  

**Saiki:**  
Yeah, it’s a “Dream Glow Mask Pack,” watermelon-scented, for firming and aging care.  

**Kobato:**  
Your face is going to vanish, po!  

**Saiki:**  
(laughs) It really will. Thank you!  

**Kobato:**  
Alright, next is Kobato, po. Opening now—oh! A **candle**, po!  

**Kanami:**  
It smells nice, doesn’t it?  

**Kobato:**  
It’s a mini candle, po! So cute!  

**Kanami:**  
Let’s all get one and match!  

**Kobato:**  
Kanami-chan’s going to buy one too, po! Thank you, po!  

**Kanami:**  
I went to two department stores to find something that everyone would like.  
I worried so much about what people might already have or dislike!  

**MISA:**  
That’s amazing, po! It’s a **salt and pepper grinder**—super handy!  

**Akane:**  
I always use rock salt and black pepper, so this is perfect!  

**Kobato:**  
The best! So convenient, po!  

**Kanami:**  
Can I open the one for Saiki myself? I want to give it to her directly.  

**Kobato:**  
Alright, po! It’s starting to feel more like a personal gift than an exchange, po.  

**Saiki:**  
(laughs) True!  

**Kobato:**  
You two even look like you’re matching today!  

**Saiki:**  
Yeah, we’re wearing matching outfits!  

**Kanami:**  
Open it, Saiki!  

**Saiki:**  
What is this? What’s inside? Wait—what? It’s a **pufferfish figurine**?  

**Kanami:**  
Yup! And I’ll send the real thing later—**fugu sashimi** by delivery!  

**Kobato:**  
Fugu sashimi get, po!  

**Saiki:**  
So cute! I’ll name it Fugu Sashi.  

**MISA:**  
Nice name!  

**Kobato:**  
Okay, next—Akane!  

**Akane:**  
Mine’s from Kanami! It’s a **fluffy towel**—it gets softer the more you wash it!  
It’s called the “Grow Towel.”  

**Kanami:**  
Yeah, it expands and gets twice as fluffy over time!  

**Kobato:**  
There’s also a **clay face pack** that can double as **bath powder**, po!  

**Akane:**  
That’s perfect! I’ll use it when I soak in the bath.  

**Kobato:**  
Yay! Everyone got such nice gifts!  
That was our BAND-MAID Christmas gift exchange, po!  

**All:**  
Merry Christmas, po!
