🎥 Akane’s Favorite Figures – Part 2 (Maid’s Room)

Akane:
Hello, Masters and Princesses! It’s Akane!

Today, I’ll be continuing with Part 2 of my favorite figures showcase!
This time, I’ll try not to go over time like before — so let’s move quickly through it!
Alright, let’s get started!

⚡ Zenitsu from Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba

Last time, I still had some unopened figures,
and actually… there are still a few more!

Here’s one that I think many of you will recognize —
it’s from Demon Slayer!

This is Zenitsu Agatsuma — my favorite character!
Let’s open it up!

Okay, it’s open!
Oh, I see — this one needs to be assembled.

Alright, let’s put it together.

“Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash!”
— that famous scene!

Zenitsu may act cowardly and cry a lot,
but when it’s time to fight, he really pulls through.
He’s such a cool character.
He’s kind, caring, and honestly just a really good boy.
That’s why he’s my favorite!

🍩 Shinobu Oshino from Bakemonogatari

Next, I want to introduce the figure that actually started my whole figure collection —
a very special one.

Ta-dah!
Shinobu-chan from Bakemonogatari!

When I saw this figure for the first time,
I completely fell in love with the beauty of figures.

Her face is so cute — Shinobu-chan’s face is just adorable!
This one is what got me hooked.

This figure is from the Bakemonogatari 5th Anniversary Ichiban Kuji Premium.
It’s the “Last One” Prize version — Shinobu-chan in Koyomi’s casual outfit.

For those who don’t know, the Last One Prize
is given to the person who buys the very last ticket in an Ichiban Kuji lottery.

I wanted this one so badly — really, so badly!
But I couldn’t get it from the lottery itself.

So I searched all around the figure shops in Akihabara,
and finally, after a long hunt, I managed to find her!
She’s my very first figure —
and she means so much to me.

🎁 Another Shinobu — A Precious Gift

Next is another Shinobu-chan figure,
and this one also has a very special memory attached to it.

Isn’t she adorable? Too cute, right?
Look at this — she’s holding a donut!

Yes, a donut — because Shinobu-chan loves donuts! 🍩

This figure is also from an Ichiban Kuji —
the “Snack Time” series, B Prize, Chocolate Version Shinobu-chan.

And this one was actually…
a birthday gift from the wonderful staff at Shibuya Eggman,
the live house where BAND-MAID used to perform often.

After one of our Okyuji there,
the staff called out to me as I was leaving:
“Hey, we have a present for you!”

They said, “You’re going to love this!”
and I was like, “What could it be?”

I thought maybe it was some funny gag gift or something —
but when I opened it and saw Shinobu-chan,
I literally dropped to my knees with happiness.

I was so close to tears!
It was such a warm, thoughtful gift from everyone at Eggman.
I’m truly grateful — this figure is full of special memories.
And she’s just so cute!

💛 More Shinobu Figures

Oh, and here’s another one —
Shinobu-chan sitting on a chair.
Her expression is so beautiful!

Actually, I really love tiny Shinobu figures,
but I only have three larger ones like these.

The reason is —
Shinobu-chan is such a popular character
that her figures always sell out immediately!

There was even a collaboration event called Madogatari
(a crossover between Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Bakemonogatari),
and they sold limited-edition Shinobu figures —
one hugging Kyubey,
and another dressed in Mami-san’s costume.

They both sold out instantly. I couldn’t get them at all!

That’s how insanely popular Shinobu-chan is.
So it’s really hard to collect her figures.

But I’ll keep trying —
slowly but surely, I’ll keep entering Ichiban Kuji and collecting them!

🩷 Closing Message

And that’s all of my favorite figures!
Every single one of them is so special to me.

They’re all my favorites — including Asuka from the last video!

Everyone, I hope you spend a relaxing day
surrounded by the things you love at home too.

This video ended up being long again —
split into Part 1 and Part 2 —
but thank you so much for watching all the way through!

This was Akane — see you again!
Bye-bye! 👋
