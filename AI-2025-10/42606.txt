## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Kanami (6 of 10)

**Kanami:**
Hello, itâ€™s Kanami on guitar.

Today Iâ€™d like to introduce **A-chan (Akane)**!  

Among all the members, sheâ€™s the one Iâ€™ve known the longestâ€”  
itâ€™s been almost ten years now!  

Sheâ€™s the **mood maker** of the band, always making everyone laugh.  
Her heart is so pure that she can easily open up anyoneâ€™s heartâ€”  
itâ€™s a special kind of talent she has.  

And when it comes to drums, she practices every single day, over and over,  
and has truly become the **backbone of the band**.  

Thatâ€™s all from Kanami!
