🎬 BAND-MAID – “Gion-cho” MV: Behind the Scenes (Part 1)

[Unknown speaker]:
They’re going to walk in saying “Hai-sai!” — just like in Okinawa!

[Unknown speaker]:
They said they’re going to sing an Okinawan-style song. But this area already feels kind of seaside.

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s beautiful here.

[Unknown speaker]:
Yeah, really beautiful.

[Unknown speaker]:
It’s so pretty, it almost feels like we’re in Okinawa.

[Unknown speaker]:
That’s amazing! So good! So good!

[Unknown speaker]:
What’s her name again—the one in the front?

[Unknown speaker]:
So pretty!

[Unknown speaker]:
Pretty!

[Unknown speaker]:
Pretty!

🔮 Akane’s Fortune Reading

[Unknown speaker]:
You know those fortune things? If you pull one today, you might cry! Let’s all go pull one later!

Akane (probably):
I’ll do one! I always get “the person you’re waiting for will not come.”

But my luck for work is great this time—it’s right on point!

Local Vendor (likely Speaker 4):
See, if you touch it like this, the beads move along.
Once they all connect, you let go—and then a number appears in the center.

Akane (probably Speaker 2):
I see! When should I make my wish? While I’m doing it?
Okay… I want to be happy. I want to be loved.

Local Vendor:
Alright—number 9.

[Unknown speaker]:
That’s mid-level luck!

Akane:
It says: “The more you think about the other person, the more things backfire.
Are you forcing your feelings onto them?”

And—
“It’s best to consult with someone older and decide carefully.”
I’ve got plenty of older people around—only older ones, actually! (laughs)

It says my best match is a Taurus, someone from Kansai or Hokuriku.
Also, parks and open spaces are lucky for me.

[Unknown speaker]:
You’ll be waiting in a park then. You like parks, right?

Akane:
I love them!

“Spend your days with a calm heart, like the vast ocean.”
That’s a good fortune.

[Unknown speaker]:
Daikon-po. (a pun, joking tone)

🥶 Cold Weather on Set

[Unknown speaker]:
At first, I thought the drum set was frozen! It’s that cold!

Akane:
Yeah, it’s freezing—but it’s still fun!

[Unknown speaker]:
Take a photo—seriously, take one! It’s unbelievable!

[Unknown speaker]:
Totally unbelievable.

🎂 Saiki’s Birthday Surprise

[Unknown speaker]:
And now… a big congratulations!

[Unknown speaker]:
She’s really grown up, hasn’t she? Congratulations!

[Unknown speaker]:
She even stretched out her legs! Totally grown. (laughs)

[Unknown speaker]:
Congratulations!
