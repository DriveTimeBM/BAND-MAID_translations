ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Saiki (4 of 10)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters and Princesses. Itâ€™s Saiki.

Apparently, this time the other members are doing an introduction about me,
but since I donâ€™t know what they said, Iâ€™m feeling a bit nervous.

Hmmâ€¦ I wonder what kind of things they saidâ€”
maybe something about me being shy,
or about the things that happen when Iâ€™ve been drinking?

Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing it.

Thatâ€™s all from Saiki.
