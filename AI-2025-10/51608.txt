**Akane:**
Hello, itâ€™s Akane.

When Iâ€™m at home, my favorite way to spend time is by **relaxing with scents I love**.  
Recently, I finally got my hands on a **Dot All BraniÃ¨s room fragrance**â€”something Iâ€™d admired for ages!  

I was so happy that now, every day, Iâ€™m surrounded by that scent and feeling blissful.  
My goal is to one day buy the **extra-large size** and fill my whole house with this fragrance.  

Whether itâ€™s room sprays or bath salts, finding a scent that truly relaxes you can make your home time feel special.  

Thatâ€™s all from Akane.  
Thank you for watching!
