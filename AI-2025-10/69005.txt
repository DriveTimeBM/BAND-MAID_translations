🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (February 2022)

Hey, it’s MISA.

For this month’s song, I’ll go with “awkward.”

When I listened to it again for the first time in a while,
I thought, “Wow, this really is a good song.”

At last year’s Christmas acoustic live,
I played it together with Kanami and Sai-chan—
it already feels nostalgic.

Time really flies, doesn’t it?
It’s already February.

The cold days are continuing,
so everyone, please take care not to catch a cold.

One-twelfth of the year is already over—
time moves so fast.

See you all again soon. Bye-bye.
