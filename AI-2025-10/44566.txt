MISA:
Hello, it’s MISA.

This question is from Maru-san:
“I’m a beginner at bass. What should I practice first?
By the way, I just got a 5-string bass.”

In my case, when I was a beginner, I started by learning songs from artists I liked.
I think it’s super important to first understand the fun of the bass’s sound
and the satisfying feeling of the strings vibrating as you play.

Also, there are tons of basic practice videos on YouTube,
so I recommend practicing along with those.

And wow—a 5-string bass for a beginner? That’s impressive!

Thanks for the question. Bye-bye!
