## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ MISA (1 of 10)

**MISA:**
Hello everyone, itâ€™s MISA. How have you been?

This timeâ€™s theme is **introducing Kobato**.  

Kobato is a girl with a **narrow forehead**, **cool shoulders**, and a **love for horse racing**.  
Among all the members, sheâ€™s also **the strongest drinker**.  

When we drink together, and I start to get drunk,  
she always **lends me her shoulder**â€”kindly and coolly.  

Sheâ€™s such a **warm and adorable woman**.  
I love Kobato.  

Thatâ€™s all from MISA.
