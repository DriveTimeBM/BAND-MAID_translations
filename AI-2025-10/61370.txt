🎥 Kobato & Saiki

Kobato:
Kobato here. Today I’d like to have a talk between the two of us — the two vocalists. Please don’t break anything, po! (laughs)

Since it’s a rare chance to have both of us together, I thought we’d talk about vocal recording, because we actually haven’t discussed it much before. I think a lot of Masters and Princesses might be curious about how that works.

So, what do you usually find most interesting about recording, po?

Saiki:
Hmm… well, I guess it’s more like, how we even do it from the start, right? We’ve never really explained that.

Kobato:
Right, right. So, basically, BAND-MAID doesn’t record the vocals together with the band. The instruments are usually recorded first, and then on a separate day, the two of us record vocals.

Usually, Saiki goes first to record the main vocals, and then Kobato comes in afterward, po.

Saiki:
Yeah, that’s right.

Kobato:
During recording, Poydora is there too, and the vocal director, our teacher, helps guide us. We go through things pretty carefully, adjusting and tightening up as we go, po.

Saiki:
Yeah, it’s like we tweak things on the spot. That’s how it usually goes.

Kobato:
Sometimes we make changes in the studio even after preparing in advance, po.
But during the most recent recordings—like during the social distancing period—we couldn’t really do that, so everything was more about preparing and checking remotely.

We even listened to recorded takes through the internet, po! The instruments too.
It actually worked really efficiently, so we might continue doing some of that from now on.

Saiki:
Yeah, it ended up working better than expected.

Kobato:
Before, we’d often change things right there in the studio, po.
Back then, we’d record a lot of songs in one day—three songs minimum, po!
Like, “You have to finish three today or there’s no other day for vocals!” (laughs)

So we’d just power through—wake up early, stay in the studio till midnight… it was rough, po.

But it made us tougher, mentally too, po.

Saiki:
Yeah, we got stronger from that. (laughs)

Kobato:
I usually spend around six hours recording a song—especially for main vocals or when we’re adding ad-libs, po.
Sometimes it’s faster—like two hours—if it’s a simple track with fewer chorus layers.

BAND-MAID songs often have three or more main vocal takes layered, but some songs are simpler—those go faster.

“awkward” and “anemone” were fast ones, right, po?

Saiki:
Yeah, back then I hadn’t even recorded backing vocals yet.

Kobato:
Right, that started around Unseen World, po.
From that album, we started mixing in our vocals more to make the songs sound brighter and more layered.

Before that, I mostly sang just the main parts, and then said, “Okay, good work, po~!” and went home. (laughs)

But we’ve really sped up since then, po.
We can record more songs in the same amount of time now, po.
We’ve gotten used to it.

Before, it was hard to spend a lot of time on one song, especially when recording during tours, po.
Now we can take our time and focus more carefully.

Saiki:
Yeah, that’s true.

Kobato:
Because of that, we can make small changes on the spot, too.
We have more freedom to try new ideas now—that’s a big improvement, po.

By the way, how many times have we changed microphones?

Saiki:
I think about three times.

Kobato:
Yeah, around three, po.
We’ve even switched mics depending on the song recently.
In the early days, it was hard to find ones that suited our voices, po.

Saiki:
Yeah, finding the right mic was tough.

Kobato:
We tried so many—spending hours testing each one, po.
And since our voices change a little every year,
we’ve adjusted for that too—especially after your surgery, right?

Saiki:
Yeah, after that, my tone became too clean—like, too strong in the highs.

Kobato:
Right, so we used mics that softened that harshness.
We even switched mid-session sometimes, depending on your vocal condition, po.

But really, the result was amazing—it felt like your voice had been reborn, po!

Saiki:
Yeah, it sounded really fresh after that.

Kobato:
Our whole approach to sound has evolved since then, po.
The way we mix vocals, too—
our preferences have changed as we’ve grown.

Before, during our indie days, when the engineer asked,

“What kind of sound do you want?”
we’d just say,
“Um… not sure, we’ll leave it up to you!”

Now, we have clear opinions and know what kind of sound we want, po.
If you listen and compare, I think you can really hear the growth.

So please keep watching how our sound continues to evolve, po!

That’s all for today!
Bye-bye, po! 🕊️

✅ Notes:

Theme: Vocal recording process — how BAND-MAID’s two singers work and how it’s evolved.

Timeline references: From early indies → Unseen World → current remote workflow.

Tone: Light, candid, funny at times; Kobato’s playful “po~” contrasts with Saiki’s calm realism.

Key insight: Growth from “leaving things to staff” to taking creative control of their sound.
