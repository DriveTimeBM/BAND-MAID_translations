🎙️ “Drinking Stories, Part 2”

Kobato (MC):
Welcome home, Masters and Princesses, po!
Kuruppo—this is Kobato Miku, po!

Saiki:
Saiki here.

Kanami:
Kanami.

Akane:
Akane.

MISA:
MISA.

🍶 Studio Reunion

Kobato:
This is the third time we’re doing a fan club radio, po!
And today, we’re recording from the studio, not remotely, po!

It’s been such a long remote period—how has everyone been, po?

All:
Happy to see everyone again!

Kobato:
Right, po! During the remote sessions, we had lots of connection issues—especially with Kanami-chan, po!

Akane:
Yeah, there was always that time lag.

Kobato:
Kanami’s video would freeze every time, po! But now that we’re together, no more weird accidents, po!
So, let’s jump right in, po!

🥂 Theme: “What Happens When BAND-MAID Drinks”

Kobato:
Today’s topic is—
👉 “What each BAND-MAID member is like when they drink,” po!

A very BAND-MAID theme, po!
We often say that our afterparties are like pirate banquets, po, so today we’ll share what really happens behind the scenes, po!

Our first radio was about first impressions,
our second was childhood dreams,
and now—the drunk edition, po!

🍺 MISA’s Constant Drinking

Kobato:
Everyone knows this already, but MISA-chan drinks even during Okyuji, po!

So in a way, our Masters and Princesses already know her “drunk mode” best, po!

MISA:
Hey, that’s not wrong. (laughs)

🍉 Kanami’s “Suika Show” Incident

Kobato:
And Kanami-chan—some fans might not know this,
but during the Akasaka BLITZ “Suika” concert,
she stole MISA’s drink, took a sip, and shouted into my mic:

“Isn’t this crowd too quiet? Come on!”

After that, my mic reeked of alcohol, po!

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
It was so funny, po! That might’ve been the only time Kanami got tipsy.

Kanami:
Yeah, that was a rare one.

😴 Kanami the Sleepy Drinker

Kobato:
Kanami isn’t a strong drinker, so she usually gets sleepy right away, po.
She misses the most exciting part of the afterparties because she’s already gone to bed, po!

Akane:
Yeah, she’s always the first to leave.

Kobato:
She says “I’m sleepy, I’m going back!” and disappears.
But later, A-chan goes to get her, po!

Akane:
Yeah, I tuck her in first, then return to the party.

Kobato:
Such dedication, po! A-chan’s caretaker mode, po!

🍷 Akane the Sober Hero

Kobato:
A-chan doesn’t drink much either, po!

Akane:
Yeah, I can’t handle it well. I get sleepy fast.

Kobato:
Even without alcohol, A-chan can hang with drunk people all night, po!
That’s amazing, po!

Saiki:
Yeah, staying sober and still matching everyone’s energy is rare.

Kobato:
She’s got talent, po!
Though lately, she can drink sweet dessert wine—like Kenzo Estate, po!

Kanami:
I love that one!

Kobato:
We’ll drink it on A-chan’s birthday, po!

🍋 Saiki and MISA’s Lost Night

Kobato:
Alright—now for the funniest story, po!

There was this one night when both Sai-chan and MISA got drunk and called me at 10:30 p.m., po!

Saiki:
We started drinking at 2 p.m.!

Kobato:
That’s eight hours, po! No wonder!

Apparently, MISA lost memory around 9, and Saiki went blank around 10.
So when they called, they were already gone, po!

Saiki said,

“Kobato, help me… I don’t know where I am.”

And I said,

“It’s only 10:30, po!”

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
She didn’t even know what GPS was anymore, po!
I said, “Check your phone map,” and she said, “There’s GPS on my phone?!”

I was like, “You called me on it, po!!”

They tried to take the train home before I convinced them to take a taxi, po.
And the whole time, I stayed on the phone for an hour and a half, po!

Akane:
(laughing) You’re basically their guardian angel.

Kobato:
Exactly, po!

😹 MISA’s Drunk Personality

Kobato:
When MISA drinks too much, she becomes adorable, po!
She hugs me and says, “Kobatooo…” and starts crying, po!

Saiki:
Like a baby.

Kobato:
She asks me to pat her head, and she purrs like a cat, po!
Sometimes she even falls asleep on my shoulder—it’s the perfect pillow, po!

Kanami:
That’s so cute!

Kobato:
Right, po! She’s like a little pet, po!

🧟 Kobato the “Zombie Maid”

Saiki:
But Kobato’s not innocent either.

Kobato:
What?!

Saiki:
When you drink too much sake—like eight servings—you turn into a zombie.

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
That’s not true, po! I just get sleepy and start walking half-asleep, po!

Akane:
That’s exactly a zombie.

Saiki:
She even walks around muttering.

Kobato:
Half of me’s asleep, half awake, so it’s like Zombie Kobato, po!

Apparently, I need to drink two 720ml bottles of sake to reach that point, po!

Saiki:
That’s insane.

Kobato:
But with the members, I never get that far—because someone’s always drunker first, po!

😭 The Crying Drunk and the Hug Monster

Kobato:
MISA always cries near the end, po—like “Aahh…” teary baby mode, po!

She hugs me and says “Pat me, Kobato…” and I do this under her chin, po!

All:
(laughs)

Kobato:
She loves it, po. She’s like a cat, po.

Saiki:
And you’re her best pillow.

Kobato:
I know, po!

🧉 The “Drinking Monsters”

Saiki:
Honestly, we’re all kind of monsters when we drink.

Kobato:
Yeah, 妖怪 (youkai)—drinking spirits, po! (laughs)

Kanami:
If I saw you all drunk, I’d think you weren’t human.

Kobato:
Exactly, po! But it’s all in good fun—our pirate banquets, po!

⚡ Closing & Song Choice

Kobato:
We’ve shared so many secrets today, po!
It might’ve been too revealing, po!

But now it’s time to wrap up—since this is a radio show,
let’s pick a song that makes your drink go down faster, po!

Kanami-chan, please choose!

Kanami:
Okay—this song always makes me want to drink more.

Kobato:
Or, as we’d say, “It’s a song for explosive drinking,” po!

Saiki:
(laughing) You mean a song that pairs well with drinks.

Kobato:
Right, po! That’s it, po!

Kanami:
Then please enjoy — “Play.”

All:
Kanpai~!
