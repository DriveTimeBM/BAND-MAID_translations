🎥 Maid’s Room – Kobato’s Movie Recommendations #3

Welcome home, Masters and Princesses—kuruppo!
It’s Kobato and Torao, po! 🕊️🐈

This is the third episode of Kobato’s Room,
brought to you by one maid and one bird (and one cat!), po!

Kuruppo!

So, in the last episode—episode two—
Kobato gave you all a little quiz, po!
Do you remember, po?

At the end, I said:
“The next movie I introduce will be one that inspired the lyrics of a BAND-MAID song!”

Did you figure it out, po?
Maybe not, right? (laughs)

Well, the answer is…
the movie The Big Short! 💰

And the song that it inspired is…
‘Unfair Game.’ 🎵

💰 The Big Short (2015)

This movie came out in 2015 in America.
I watched it right around the time I was writing the lyrics for Unfair Game, po!

It’s such a deep film.
The Big Short is based on true events—
it tells the story of the subprime mortgage crisis,
the real financial collapse that happened in the United States.

It’s based on a nonfiction book by Michael Lewis,
titled “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine” (2010 in Japan as 『世紀の空売り』).

After watching the movie,
I was so curious that I researched it and learned it was a true story,
and that realization hit me hard, po!

I thought, “Reality can be even more incredible than fiction,”
and it really made me think deeply about the world.

I already knew that Brad Pitt appeared in the film,
but when I looked into it, I found out
that Brad Pitt’s own production company helped produce it!
That’s amazing, right, po?

So yes—Unfair Game was inspired by The Big Short, po.

My favorite line in the Unfair Game lyrics,
the one that connects most strongly to this film, is:

“Doubt everything — the empire is your life.”

That phrase represents the image I had while watching the movie.

It’s about crisis—
and how in life, we face so many critical choices,
each one shaping the world we live in.
That’s what I learned from this movie,
and why I felt Unfair Game fit it perfectly.

🎩 Kingsman (2014)

Now, the second movie I want to recommend today is—
Kingsman!

This one is from 2014, also an American film.

It’s a spy movie, but not your typical dark, serious kind.
It’s filled with style, humor, and a touch of comedy,
so it never feels too heavy, po!

That said—
it does have a few gory moments! (laughs)
People literally explode like fireworks—
boom, boom, boom! 💥
So if you don’t like that kind of thing, be warned, po!

But it’s still such a cool movie!
Why is it so cool?
Ah, I’m glad you asked, po!

It’s because of… the suits! 👔

Kobato is a total suit-fetishist, po! (laughs)
The spies disguise themselves as high-class tailors,
so on the surface they run a luxury suit shop,
but in reality—it’s a secret spy organization!

That concept alone is already wonderful, po!

And all the suits are so stylish and elegant.
Just watching it feels like eye candy!

Even the hidden rooms, the study,
and every little prop—everything is so meticulously designed,
and it’s just beautiful, po!

Did you know?
There’s actually a sequel to Kingsman!

And in that sequel,
Kobato’s beloved Sir Elton John appears as himself! 💖

Isn’t that amazing, po?

But between the two films,
Kobato personally likes the first one more.
The story left such a strong impression—
it was more impactful and memorable to me.

I recently learned that a third film was also planned to be released—
maybe this year? (laughs)
But because of the current world situation,
the release schedule wasn’t announced yet.

When it finally comes out,
I’ll definitely go watch it, po!

It seems like the production company changed—
Disney took over in 2020—
so I’m curious how it’ll turn out,
but it looks super fun!

When it’s released,
I hope we can all watch it together and share our thoughts, po!

Oh, and one more surprise!
The lead actor, Taron Egerton,
wasn’t actually in any big movies before Kingsman!

This was his breakout role!
After that, he went on to appear in many more films.
He’s so talented—Kobato was truly impressed, po!

I’m excited to see what kind of roles he’ll play in the future.

And that’s it for today, po!
I introduced The Big Short and Kingsman,
two of Kobato’s favorite films!

If either of them sound interesting to you,
please give them a watch, po!

This was Kobato and Torao’s Room, po~!
Bye-bye, po!

Torao’s struggling—he’s not happy about being held, po! (laughs)
Bye-bye, po~! Kuruppo! 🕊️💞

💡 Fan Notes

“Po!” (ぽー): Kobato’s signature chirp, used to end most of her sentences.

Torao (トラオ): Kobato’s cat, often “appearing” in her vlogs, sometimes protesting affection.

“Unfair Game” (アンフェアゲーム): BAND-MAID song lyrically inspired by The Big Short.

“Doubt everything — the empire is your life.”: A direct reflection of The Big Short’s message about questioning systems and choices.

Tone: Bright, passionate, slightly nerdy — a mix of Kobato’s humor and her deep thoughtfulness as a lyricist.
