ðŸ’¬ Voice Message to Fan Club Members â€“ MISA (4 of 4)

MISA:
Hey, itâ€™s MISA.

This question is from Himawari Ojiji-san.

At first, I was using GarageBand,
but now Iâ€™m using Cubase.

Compared to when I first started doing interviews,
my workspace setup has leveled up quite a bit.

The item that made my heart race the most when I bought it
was definitely my audio interfaceâ€”
I got the Universal Audio Apollo Twin X Quad.

Itâ€™s been working great for me ever since.

Thatâ€™s allâ€”bye-bye!
