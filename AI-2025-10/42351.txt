🎥 Maid’s Room – Tokyo Maze

Saiki:
Masters, hello. It’s Saiki.

Alright, once again, I’ll be introducing sneakers without giving up. (laughs)

First, let’s take a look at the box.
Here it is—black.

Do you know something called Nike: On Air?

“Nike: On Air” was the name of a sneaker design contest held by Nike across six cities worldwide to create new Air Max models.
Among those six cities was Tokyo, Japan,
and from that event, this pair was one of the four designs selected.

Here it is.

Pretty bold, right?

This design—
the maze-like pattern—was inspired by the Tokyo subway system.

And the red accents on the back,
the inner lining, and even the text on the sole—
those reds represent the color of Tokyo Tower.

On the left shoe,
it’s a white base with black lines as accents.
On the right,
it’s a black base with white lines for contrast.

The name of this sneaker is Tokyo Maze.
It even says so on the back—Tokyo Maze.
Cool, right?

One of the notable features of this model is that
it comes with lots of shoelaces.
Right here—
you can even customize them using touch-up tape, which can be peeled off and replaced.

So, like this—
if I choose one that has the name printed on it,
it looks nice.
You can have fun customizing it however you like.

I didn’t buy this one myself when it was released.
There are a lot of sneaker fans out there, right?
And sometimes you meet people and become friends through your shared love of sneakers.

One of those people actually gave me this pair.

It was a married couple—the husband had bought them for his wife,
but the design didn’t really fit her taste.
And when we were talking,
he said, “I’ll gladly pass them on to you.”

That’s how I got this adorable pair of sneakers.

See you again next time.
Bye-bye. 👋
