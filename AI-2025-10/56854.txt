🎵 Song of the Month – Kanami (May)

Kanami:
Hello, it’s Kanamincho. How are you all doing?

For this month’s “Song of the Month,” the one that fits my mood is “Youth.”

This song was written with the idea of bringing out a twin-vocal feel between Sai-chan and Kobato,
and I always thought it would be great if everyone could get excited together during the Okyuji.

We were finally able to perform it on Maid Day,
so I was really happy about that!

Please be sure to check out that performance video too—I’d love for you to see it.
