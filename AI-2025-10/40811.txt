🎥 Akane’s Anime Talk – Full Natural English Translation

Akane:
Hey everyone! It’s Akane!

Today, I’d like to talk about one of my hobbies.
I’m sure some of you OMEISYUSAMA already know this,
but I love anime — I’m a total anime otaku!

So, I thought I’d talk in detail about what anime I first watched,
and which one made me fall so deeply in love with anime.
Please enjoy!

🧢 The Armband

First of all — I think many of you might be curious about this armband that says “団長” (“Leader”).
This is from the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

The main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, wears this as the leader of the SOS Brigade —
which stands for “Spreading Excitement All Over the World with Haruhi Suzumiya.”

It’s a legendary anime — a mix of comedy and sci-fi —
so popular it’s considered the ultimate “moe × sci-fi” series.

The ending theme Hare Hare Yukai was super famous!
All the characters dance and sing together in the ending,
and that was so fresh and fun at the time.

There was this huge boom on Nico Nico Douga —
people uploading “I tried dancing!” videos of that routine.
Of course, I danced it too!
And in cosplay!

I didn’t upload it or anything,
but I gathered my otaku friends from school,
and we all dressed up as different characters.
I was Haruhi!
We filmed it just for fun — such great memories.

This is the costume from back then.
Aah, so nostalgic!
Such good times…

🌙 The First Anime I Ever Watched

Now, going back to the main topic —
the very first anime I ever watched.

I think it was Sailor Moon when I was really little.
Of course I loved it — I had tons of merch!

But the anime I loved even more than Sailor Moon
was Cardcaptor Sakura!
Sakura is my all-time favorite.

When the Clear Card Arc anime aired in 2018,
my love for Sakura came back to life again.
Seriously, I adore Sakura!

🧸 Kero-chan Time!

Ta-dah! Kero-chan!
Isn’t he adorable?
This one I bought at the Sakura Exhibition in 2018.

Look at the back — so cute too!
He’s just the best, right? Kero-chan!

I also bought clear files at that event.
See? Sakura and Kero-chan —
so cute!
Just perfect.

💖 My Favorite Era

Personally, I love the early Sakura the most —
when she used the Sealing Wand and collected the Clow Cards.

I even had a Sealing Wand myself!
And the Sealing Key that Sakura always wears —
my mom turned one into a necklace for me,
so I could wear it to school.

I probably even carried my Clow Cards around too.
They sold a full Clow Card set, and I totally had it!

So yeah — I was literally doing everything Sakura did!
Adorable, right?

✨ My Treasures

Oh, I have something I really want to show everyone.
Look!
Isn’t this amazing?

It’s a special Sakura clear card edition!
So cute. I don’t want to get it dirty,
so I keep it safe at home — it’s a real treasure.

🛍 Nakano Broadway Adventure

Oh yeah — about a year and a half ago,
I went to Nakano Broadway, and there was a cosplay shop.

They were selling Sakura’s original pink frilly costume,
with the hat and everything —
it was so cute!

They even had a full-sized Sealing Wand in the showcase,
about as tall as Sakura herself —
it was huge!

I seriously debated buying the costume and wand together.
But when I told the other members,
they all went, “Absolutely not. Don’t buy it.” (laughs)

🩰 Akane’s Thoughts on Cosplay

I’m not really into doing cosplay myself —
I’m not that kind of person —
but I really love looking at anime costumes.

When I see them, I just get so excited.
They make me want to buy them all!

Since we’re spending more time at home these days…
maybe I should just buy one and play “Sakura” by myself?
(laughs)
Would that be sad? Maybe.
But it’d be fun, too!
I’ll think about it.

💬 Closing Message

Once I start talking about anime,
I just can’t stop — so I’ll end it here!

There are so many wonderful anime out there,
so why not spend some time at home watching them?

See you again in the next video!
This was Akane — bye bye! 👋
