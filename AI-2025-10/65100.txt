🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (November)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

This month’s song is “Anemone,” po!

It’s the ending theme for our regular radio show, BAND-MAID Nippon, po!
Every time we record, I always think,
“This song fits the ending perfectly—it’s such a good song,” po!

Everyone, please keep looking forward to the broadcasts, po!

As for the photo, this is one I took while checking in on Torao-chan and Aineko(?) through the remote video feed while I was away.
When I looked, Torao-chan was staring right at the camera with glowing eyes—it was kind of scary, po!

That’s all, bye-bye, po~!
