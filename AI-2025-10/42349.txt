🎥 Maid’s Room – MISA #3

MISA:
Hello everyone. How have you been?
I’m doing well.

This time, I thought I’d introduce one of the basses I have at home—
this fretless bass. Can you see it?

A fretless bass doesn’t have frets.
On a regular bass, you can see these metal lines here,
but this fretless bass doesn’t have any at all.

I think I got this fretless bass about nine years ago,
back when I was in a band before BAND-MAID.
It was a grunge-style band,
and even so, I chose this bass.

I used to play Fender basses originally,
but at some point I got curious and thought,
“I want to try playing with a pick on a fretless bass,”
so I bought this one.

It brings back memories.

The maker of this bass is Warwick—
a Warwick RockBass.
Even though it’s fretless, it’s called a “RockBass.”
I think back then, I was partly drawn in by that name. (laughs)

Basses with frets have a clearer, sharper tone,
but a fretless bass has a softer, floating sound.

Alright, let’s try playing it so you can hear what it sounds like.

Let’s start with a slide.

Like this—
because there are no frets, the slide just keeps going endlessly.
It’s interesting, isn’t it?

Since there are no frets,
it’s easy to lose track of where you’re playing—
even for me.

A tiny difference in position changes the pitch completely,
so it’s hard to play accurately.

I just came up with an interesting phrase.

Now let’s try playing it with a pick.

(plays)
Pitch control is tough.
If you’re even slightly off,
it sounds really strange—like this.
So it definitely takes practice.

Lastly, I’ll just play something freely.

(plays)

If you ever get the chance,
please try playing a fretless bass for yourself.

That’s all for now.
This was MISA.
