[Unknown Speaker]
So, after looking back at how the year has flowed, now we’re in 2025!  
What kind of year do you want to make it? What do you want to do? Anything you want to achieve?

[Unknown Speaker]
Of course, like… overseas again maybe? What kind of year do you want? Do you have any goals?

[Unknown Speaker]
It’s not the things that come true that make me emotional, it’s the ones that didn’t.

[Unknown Speaker]
You’re getting deep right from the New Year (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, because you don’t *have* to make everything happen this year. It’s okay if it takes longer.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right — your goals don’t have to all come true in one year. So, what do you want to do?

[Unknown Speaker]
Okay, I’ll just say it then, even if it gets cut later (laughs). I want to do another Europe tour.

[Unknown Speaker]
You said that so quietly no one heard you!

[Unknown Speaker]
Why so secretive about that? (laughs)

[Unknown Speaker]
No reason! But really, everyone’s thinking it.

[Unknown Speaker]
Then say it proudly, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Okay, one more — I’d love to play a big two-man show someday.

[Unknown Speaker]
Oh! Who would you want to play with?

[Unknown Speaker]
With The Warning again, or maybe Incubus.

[Unknown Speaker]
Nice picks! Say more — go all out!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, say it out loud, po! Show that face of determination, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
(laughs) Okay then — also Smashing Pumpkins someday.

[Unknown Speaker]
Oh wow, that’s huge!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, that would be amazing.

[Unknown Speaker]
And a full-on live battle — I want to do that too.

[Unknown Speaker]
That’d be awesome! Saying it out loud makes it more real, po! Dreams come closer that way, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
Exactly, po. We’ve already achieved so many things we once said we wanted to.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, so it’s good to keep saying it.

[Unknown Speaker]
Right, speaking your goals matters. After Yokohama Arena, next I want to fill a venue with all our Masters and Princesses again — maybe even an arena tour!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes! I want to do that too!

[Unknown Speaker]
That arena show was so fun, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
Yeah, it was too fun — maybe too much fun (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
We worried if everyone made it home okay that night, po, but it was wonderful.  
And my best friend came to that show — she said, “Three hours for this ticket price? What a deal!” (laughs)

[Unknown Speaker]
That’s so cute!

[Unknown Speaker]
Right? I wanted to give her a little pat on the head — air pat! (laughs)  
Seeing people say things like that online makes us so happy. It makes us think, “I’m glad we worked so hard.”

[Unknown Speaker]
Totally. That’s why we keep going.

[Unknown Speaker]
And, you know, BAND-MAID always loves surprises, po! We just want to make everyone smile, po.  
Seeing happy faces makes us want to do even more. Thank you, always.

[Unknown Speaker]
We want to go meet everyone again this year!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes, definitely. Europe is on everyone’s mind, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
I really want to go to Mexico, too — to play a festival there!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes, you said that before — that’s so you (laughs).

[Unknown Speaker]
And The Warning are from Mexico, too, so maybe we can tour with them there again!  
We love Mexico — the food, the energy, the music, everything.

[Unknown Speaker]
The vibe there is just amazing. The streets, the sounds — it’s so lively.

[Unknown Speaker]
It gives you energy just being there. I’d love to go back.  
And of course, to Europe, America, Asia — there are still so many places we haven’t been.

[Unknown Speaker]
World Domination, right? (laughs)

[Unknown Speaker]
Exactly — World Domination, po!  
We want to make this another wonderful year while keeping that dream alive.

So, let’s each express what kind of year we want 2025 to be — in one kanji character.

[Unknown Speaker]
Let’s do it! I’ve got an iPad app here that works like calligraphy paper. Technology is amazing!

[Unknown Speaker]
Try writing “pigeon” (hato) first!

[Unknown Speaker]
(laughs) Okay, let’s see… oh, it came out as “water.” These apps are so advanced, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
That actually looks great! Okay, let’s each write our kanji for the year.

[Unknown Speaker]
First up… MISA?

[MISA]
Okay… my kanji is 「咲」 (saku — “bloom”).  
We’ve been blooming little by little, but there are still more buds waiting to open. I want us to bloom even more this year.

[Unknown Speaker]
That’s beautiful!

[Unknown Speaker]
Lovely choice, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Next, Kanami?

[Kanami]
Mine is 「強」 (“strong”).  
Because, honestly, I’m a total softie inside (laughs). But I want to be mentally stronger this year — and make strong songs, too!

[Unknown Speaker]
Strong songs, po! We love those!

[Unknown Speaker]
Next up, Akane?

[Akane]
Mine is 「踏」 (“step” or “pedal”). Because Kanami said she’s writing strong songs, and that means I’ll be stepping (on the double pedal) a lot this year!  
I’m training hard — 2025 will be a year of stepping!

[Unknown Speaker]
踏みまくれ (keep stomping!), po!

[Unknown Speaker]
Now, Kobato?

[Kobato]
Mine is 「飛」 (“fly”). It’s not just about flying literally — it’s about taking off, jumping higher, and keeping the energy up!  
I want BAND-MAID to take flight and reach new heights this year, po!

[Unknown Speaker]
That’s so positive and lovely, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
Finally, Saiki?

[Saiki]
Mine is 「楽」 (“fun” / “music”).  
I want to live more easily, have fun, and enjoy making music. It’s also the kanji for “music,” so it fits perfectly.  
I want to have fun with my bandmates and bring more joy to our Masters and Princesses!

[Unknown Speaker]
That’s wonderful. These kanji really reflect each of you perfectly, po.

[Unknown Speaker]
So let’s make 2025 a wonderful year together with our Masters and Princesses — through every Okyuji!

[Unknown Speaker]
It’s been twelve years since we started BAND-MAID — time really flies! It’s like completing a zodiac cycle and starting anew. A new chapter begins!

[Unknown Speaker]
Yes! So once again — to all Masters and Princesses, let’s meet at the next Okyuji in February, and make this another fantastic year together!
