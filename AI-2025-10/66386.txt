🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (December)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

Spring, summer, autumn, winter—before I knew it, another year has passed, po!

This month’s song is “Rinne,” po!

Next year, I want to perform this song during Okyuji,
headbanging together with all you Masters and Princesses, po!

The photo is one of me horseback riding,
beautifully taken by the photographer, po!

Let’s get through this cold winter together and move forward toward spring, po!

Bye-bye~kuruppo~!
