## ðŸ’Œ Message to Fan Club Members â€“ Kobato (10 of 10)

**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! Itâ€™s **Kobato Miku**, po!

The theme this time is **behind-the-scenes from Maid Day**, po!  

This time, I got to perform as **Kuruppo** for the opening act, po!  
And guess whatâ€”while I was performing as Kuruppo,  
the other members were watching me from the audience side, po!  

That made me *so happy*, po!  
But at the same time, seeing them made me **super nervous**, po!  

Also, during the chorus part, I was holding my pick in my hand,  
and every time I danced, Iâ€™d **toss it away** on purpose, po!  
Did anyone notice that, po?  

Thatâ€™s all for today, po! Bye-bye, po!
