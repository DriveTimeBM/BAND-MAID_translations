**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! Itâ€™s **Kobato Miku**, po!

This time, Kobato will be introducing **Sai-chan**, po!  

If I had to describe her in one phrase,  
Iâ€™d say sheâ€™s a **queen who perfectly embodies elegance and originality**, po!  

Just saying that might get me scolded, so Iâ€™ll explain properly, po.  

She loves **sneakers, Sailor Moon, shinkansen trains, and beer**,  
and sheâ€™s very **disciplined** about her muscle training, po!  

During Okyuji, she captivates Masters and Princesses with her coolness,  
but offstage, she has moments of pure cuteness that completely disarm everyone, po!  

In other wordsâ€¦ **the theory that Sai-chan is the strongest is true**, po!  

Thatâ€™s all for now. Bye-bye, po!
