## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Kobato (6 of 10)

**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! It’s **Kobato Miku**, po!

Finally, we’ve reached the last introduction—**Akane**, po!  

A-chan is the most **sociable** member of BAND-MAID, po!  
She probably knows more people than anyone else, po!  

She’s cheerful and bright, and she often eats **natto rice**, po!  
Sometimes she can be a little scatterbrained,  
and when she can’t quite pull something off, Kobato gets worried like, “Is she okay, po?”  

But she’s always **so full of energy**, and I really admire that, po!  

Also, her **funny faces** are absolutely hilarious, po!  

That’s all from Kobato, po! Bye-bye, po!
