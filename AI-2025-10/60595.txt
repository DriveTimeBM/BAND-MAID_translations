🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (August)

Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

How are you all doing?

For this month’s “Song of the Month,”
I’ll go with “One and Only.”

The reason is—
I’m not really a fan of summer itself,
but I do like summer evenings.

When this song plays during that time of day,
it just lifts my mood.

Goodbye.
