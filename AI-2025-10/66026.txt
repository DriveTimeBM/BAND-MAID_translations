🎵 Song of the Month – Saiki (December)

Saiki:
Hello, Masters. It’s Saiki.

For this month’s “Song of the Month,”
I’ll choose “Mirage.”

It’s been getting colder lately,
and I feel like “Mirage” fits this season perfectly.

Honestly, I just went with what felt right this time.

Please give it a listen. Bye-bye.
