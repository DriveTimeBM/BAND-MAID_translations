🎥 Fan Club Radio – “First Impressions” (COVID-Era Remote Talk)

Kobato (MC):
Welcome home, Masters and Princesses!
This is Kurupoo, Kobato Miku, po!

Saiki, Kanami, Akane, MISA:
Saiki here.
Kanami.
Akane.
MISA.

Kobato:
Today, we’re doing a special voice edition for our Masters and Princesses — a kind of radio-style chat, po!

Saiki:
Our first one ever, right?

Kobato:
Yes! Because of these times, we’re recording remotely, po.
Originally, we had planned a Taiwan tour for April, po…

Saiki:
Yeah, that’s right. It was never officially announced, though.

Kobato:
Exactly — it’s true! Unfortunately, that tour had to be postponed,
but instead, we wanted to bring our voices directly to you like this, po!
Since this is all done from home, the audio might be a little fuzzy here and there,
but please enjoy it anyway, po!

MISA:
Yay!

Kobato:
So, BAND-MAID has now entered our 8th year together — can you believe it? Time flies, po!

For our first episode, today’s theme is:
“Our first impressions of each other.”

MISA:
Yay!

Kobato:
We’ve talked about how we formed before,
but not much about what we thought of each other at first, po.

Saiki:
Right.

Kobato:
So today, we’ll each talk about what we thought when we first met, po!

🪄 The Early Days

Kobato:
Originally, the first people who met were me, Kanami, and Akane, right, po?

Kanami:
Yeah, the three of us met together.

Kobato:
Right, po. How did that go again?

Kanami:
Well, I met Akane back when I was doing singer-songwriter gigs,
and she drummed for me at a live house in Yokohama.
When I later heard about starting a band called BAND-MAID,
I immediately called her.

Kobato:
Right, po! What was your first impression of A-chan back then?

Kanami:
Honestly, I thought she was cute! (laughs)
But at the same time, she was kind of putting on a polite, calm front — like a “good girl” act.

Akane:
Excuse me?! (laughs)

Kanami:
I mean that in a good way! (laughs) She was quiet, very polite —
I thought, “Wow, such a nice person.”

Kobato:
So your impression was that she was wearing a cat mask (acting overly sweet), po!
A-chan, what about you?

Akane:
I thought Kanami was really cute — her eyes were huge!
Like, “Whoa, doll eyes!”

Kobato:
I thought that too, po! (laughs)

Kanami:
My voice used to be higher, too, back then.

Akane:
Yeah, we’ve all gotten deeper over eight years.

Kobato:
That’s just maturity, po! (laughs)

🎸 When MISA Entered

Kobato:
A-chan, you and MISA were classmates in music school, right, po?

Akane:
Yeah, at a music college.
My first impression of her was that she was really unique —
the kind of person I’d never met before.
She had curly hair, long bangs, wore vintage clothes —
a totally different vibe from me.

MISA:
(laughs) Yeah, I had a perm back then.

Kobato:
And you still did when you first joined BAND-MAID, right, po?

MISA:
Yeah, until about two or three years after joining.

Kobato:
Right, right, po. When did you switch to straight bangs?

MISA:
Hmm… maybe around the “CIRIUS” video.

Kobato:
Ahh, so the patsu (straight fringe) era began after that, po!

🎤 When Saiki Joined

Kobato:
So then, Saiki — you joined last, right, po?
What did everyone think when they first met her?

Kanami:
When we first met, we were recording something — maybe for For…?
I was exhausted, and apparently my eyes were dead. (laughs)

Saiki:
Yeah! I walked in and thought, “What’s going on here? Who are these people?” (laughs)
Kanami looked totally lifeless.

Kanami:
That’s because we had to lug all our own gear by train back then! (laughs)

Saiki:
Yeah, I even memorized where all the elevators were in every station because of that.

🥹 First Impressions of Saiki

Kanami:
Honestly, I thought Saiki might be the type of person I’d struggle to get along with at first.
She had this strong aura, you know?

Kobato:
Yeah, A-chan told me she might be “a little scary,” po! (laughs)
So when I first met her, I was super nervous —
I thought, If they don’t like me, it’s over, po!

Saiki:
I was just quiet! I was suspicious of everything because I’d been tricked into joining. (laughs)
I didn’t know who I could trust.

Kanami:
Yeah, that’s true — you were still feeling things out.

Saiki:
Exactly. I was like, “Who are these people? What is this?”

Kobato:
(laughs) And I remember saying hi and getting a “Huh?” face in response,
and thinking, She’s scary, po!

Saiki:
I was just shy!

Kobato:
I know, po — but I didn’t know that yet! (laughs)

🍻 Early Days of Bonding

Akane:
Remember the first time the four of us went to eat together?

MISA:
Yeah! Izakaya — we had hotpot.

Kobato:
At Kin-no-Kura, right, po?

Akane:
Yeah, that’s it!

Kobato:
That was when I thought, These people are really nice, po.
But I was still nervous.

Saiki:
(laughs) I was still suspicious!

Kobato:
But we got closer quickly — remember our late-night LINE chats?
Me, Saiki, and A-chan stayed up all night texting!
We even made a group called “Self-Hate Club,” po!

Akane:
Oh yeah, that’s right!

Saiki:
It sounds so dark now. (laughs)

Kobato:
It was supposed to be positive! Like, “Let’s try harder tomorrow,” po!

🍶 MISA’s Drinking and Kanami’s Worry

Kanami:
I remember being really worried about MISA back then,
because she was always drinking before lives!

MISA:
(laughs) Yeah, I was.

Kanami:
I thought, “Is that okay?” (laughs)

Kobato:
Kanami and Akane are both light drinkers, po,
so they were worried like older sisters.

Kanami:
Yeah, but thanks to everyone, I learned how to drink a little!

Kobato:
(laughs) You sound like you were led astray, po!

Kanami:
But it’s fun! I just get really silly when I’m tipsy.

Kobato:
That’s why we wanted you to drink, po! You’re hilarious!

💫 Closing Thoughts

Kobato:
And that’s how we’ve deepened our bonds —
and now it’s already our 8th year together, po!

Who knows, maybe we’ll all evolve again, po!

MISA:
(laughs) Evolution like Pokémon?

Kobato:
Exactly, po! Maybe we’ll get Mega Kanami, po!

Akane:
Or Rare Saiki with bonus friendliness!

Kobato:
(laughs) I’d pay to see that, po!

Anyway, thank you all so much for listening to our remote radio talk.
And now, to close, A-chan will introduce our final song!

Akane:
Alright! I choose… Wonderland!

Kobato:
Perfect choice, po! Beautiful melody, dramatic structure,
and Sai-chan’s opening vocal is so moving, po!

Kanami:
Yes — I wrote Wonderland while imagining Sai-chan singing it beautifully.

Akane:
Then please enjoy — Wonderland!
