**Kobato:**
Kuruppo! It’s **Kobato Miku**, po!

Here’s a little behind-the-scenes talk from the making of **“Unseen World”**, po!  

This time, Kobato will talk about the **lyrics**, po!  

For this album, Kobato wrote the lyrics with a strong focus on **storytelling**, po.  
For example, in “Sayonakidori,” there’s a line of dialogue partway through the song—  
and that line is actually taken from a **scene in *Romeo and Juliet***, po!  

Even the title “Sayonakidori” translates to **“Nightingale”**,  
which is also the bird mentioned in *Romeo and Juliet*, po!  

Also, in the chorus of “HGK,” Kobato used **a Russian spell phrase**, po!  
There are lots of little hidden secrets like that scattered throughout, po!  

Please listen carefully and see if you can find them all, po!
