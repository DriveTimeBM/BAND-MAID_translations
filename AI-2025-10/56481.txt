**Kanami:**
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho!

Here’s a little behind-the-scenes story from **Maid Day**.  

Four of us who were on the floor decided to play a game—  
we said, “Let’s see who can reach and touch the PA hook first!”  

And the winner was… **me, Mincho!**  
I managed to reach the hook, and it was so much fun!  

Even though the floor area was really wide,  
somehow all four of us kept ending up gathered in the same spot—  
which made us laugh a lot.  

Please check out the footage when you get a chance!
