🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (November)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

During our free time, the members and I often play games together.
Recently, I’ve gotten hooked on a puzzle game called “Machinarium,”
which Saiki recommended to me.

The other day, MISA and I got super into Mario Tennis too!

We’re currently looking for a game that all five of us can play together,
so if you have any good recommendations, please let us know!

My “Song of the Month,” related to gaming,
is “Hibana,” the battle theme for the All Japan University eSports Competition 2021.

Give it a listen!
