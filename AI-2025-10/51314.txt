**MISA:**
Hello, it’s MISA.

This time, the theme is “Recommended ways to spend your time at home.”  

When I want to have a really fulfilling day,  
I start by **jumping rope as soon as I wake up** to loosen up my body.  

Then, I take a **half-body soak in the bathtub**,  
and after getting out, I eat **breakfast**.  

That combination feels absolutely amazing,  
so everyone should try it!  

After that, I sometimes end up **taking a nap again**.  

In the afternoon, I start **drinking beer** and do whatever hobbies I enjoy—  
that makes for an even more fun day.  

Bye-bye!
