🎵 Song of the Month – Kobato (October)

Kuruppo~! It’s Kobato, po!

When I was wondering what song to choose for this month,
I asked the other members for advice, po.

Then Sai-chan said,
“It’s your birthday month, so you should pick SAYONAKIDORI!”

So that’s what I went with, po!

A birthday is such a wonderful day that comes once a year for everyone, po.
No matter how old I get, Kobato wants to keep cherishing it.

Having the members and everyone celebrate me
and say “Happy birthday!” makes me truly happy, po!

Bye-bye, po~!
