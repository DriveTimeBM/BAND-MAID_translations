🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (Summer)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane—
lately, I’ve been eating nothing but somen noodles all summer!
So, the photo I chose is Ibo no Ito (a famous somen brand).

When I was a kid, summer meant freedom—
summer vacation, going to the pool or festivals with friends—
so many fun and carefree memories.

That’s why the song I chose for this month is “FREEDOM.”

Everyone, take care not to get heatstroke or summer fatigue, okay?
See you!
