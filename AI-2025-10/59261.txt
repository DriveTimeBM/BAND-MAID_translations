Kanami:
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho.

Alright, suddenly—here’s a quiz!
Can you guess what my “Mincho Choice” song for July is?

Here’s a hint:
It’s a song released on July 25, 2018.

It’s also a song that we discussed together as a band—
we wanted it to be one that everyone could sing along to during Okyuji.

So, have you figured it out?

The answer is… “Start Over.”

Please give it a listen!
