🎥 Maid’s Room – Air Max 95

Saiki:
Masters, hello. It’s Saiki.

Alright, this time too, I’d like to introduce another pair of sneakers.

The pair I’m introducing today is the Air Max 95, the shoe that sparked the high-tech sneaker boom of the 1990s.

The box—
you’ve all probably seen this red Nike box before.
They came in this.

When it comes to Air Max 95,
the most famous and popular color is the original Yellow Gradation (Yellow Gradé).
And since I have that pair too,
I’ll show it to you.

Here it is.

This Yellow Gradé was so popular that the phrase “Air Max hunting” was even coined because of it.
Even now, whenever sneaker books are published,
or magazines feature retrospectives on that era,
you can always find photos of famous people wearing these shoes.
They really had a massive impact.

There have been many color variations of the 95,
but the one I got this time is—
this color.

It’s multicolor.
Can you see it?

It has asymmetrical color blocking,
with the design being completely different on the left and right sides,
and also between the outer and inner parts of the shoes.

A different “multicolor” version was released in 2015,
so I think this one could be considered the second edition.

I didn’t know what the first one was called,
so I looked it up—
apparently, it was called “Greedy.”

That colorway is still popular today and even resells at a premium.
I don’t own it, though.

The pair I got this time has reflective material on the collar and heel,
so it’s supposed to shine when light hits it at night.
I haven’t worn them yet,
so I don’t know firsthand—
but when I finally go out wearing them,
if I get a photo with a flash,
I’ll post it on social media.

I also thought I’d compare these to another pair I already have
that uses some of the same colors from the outer side.

This one—
the Yellow Gradé that appeared earlier.
You can see those colors used here.
The sole is different, but the gradation is beautiful—
really cute.

And on the left side,
I think that’s probably this one—
the Blue Gradé.
So cute.

I think it was Ryoko Hirosue-san who wore the Blue Gradé in a commercial—
I can’t remember if it was for Magikoi or something else—
but I remember seeing that story on a site somewhere.
Sorry, I don’t know the details.

There’s this little incident that tends to happen when I buy sneakers—
I’ll enter raffles at different sneaker shops,
and on release day,
I’ll also try buying through Nike’s SNKRS app.

For some reason,
there are times when I win both.
And that happened this time too,
so I ended up with two pairs.

But they’re cute, so it’s fine, right?
They’re cute, so I forgive myself. (laughs)

Well then,
that’s it for this episode of Saichan’s Sneaker Delivery.

See you next time when I bring more sneakers.
Bye-bye. 👋
