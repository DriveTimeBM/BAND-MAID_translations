## 💌 Message to Fan Club Members – Kanami (8 of 10)

**Kanami:**
How are you all doing? It’s Kanamincho!

If I were to express my goal for this year in **one kanji character**,  
it would be **“癒 (to heal)”**.  

Even though difficult times continue, I want to give my all to what I can do now,  
and through BAND-MAID’s music, I hope to **heal the hearts** of many people.  

At the same time, I also want to live each day remembering to **heal my own heart**, too.  

Also… I’d like to be healed by **Sai-chan**. (laughs)  

Let’s make this year another wonderful one together!
