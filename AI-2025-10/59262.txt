🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (July)

Hey everyone, it’s MISA.

For this month’s song, since the rainy season is just about over,
and it’s starting to really feel like summer with the rising temperatures
and the sound of cicadas beginning to echo,
I decided to go with a summery song—“Youth.”

By the way, the photo is of the takoyaki I just ate.
Does everyone like takoyaki?
I love it.

I want to go to a festival.
And drink some beer.

Bye.
