🎥 Maid’s Room – Kobato’s Movie Recommendations #4

Welcome, dear Princesses—kuruppo! 🕊️
It’s Kobato’s Room, episode four, po!

This time, once again, it’s Kobato and Torao bringing you the show, po~!
Kuruppo!

Now then—
for the fourth episode, the two movies Kobato will introduce today are…

🎬 The Tragic Burlesque (A.k.a. “Happy End” / “Konyec”) (2007, Hungary)
and
🎬 Amour (2012, France–Austria–Germany co-production), po!

👏👏👏👏👏

Both of these films are quite heavy in theme, po.
When Kobato watched them, she cried so much it was terrible—
her eyes were completely swollen, po! 😭

Both films center on elderly couples,
and both make you think deeply about love and life as we grow older, po.

🍷 The Tragic Burlesque / Konyec (2007, Hungary)

This film is from 2007, po—
a Hungarian movie about an elderly husband and wife
who suddenly find themselves struggling financially
because of pension issues.

To survive,
they decide to do something unthinkable…
they become bank robbers, po! 💰

Yes—this sweet, elderly couple turns to robbery!
But even as they commit the crimes,
they do it in such a gentlemanly and kindhearted way
that you can’t help but feel warmth in your heart, po.

It’s such a bittersweet story—
painful, yet somehow heartwarming.
The kind of movie that leaves you smiling through your tears.

And the ending… is absolutely shocking, po!
Kobato won’t spoil it,
because she really wants Masters and Princesses to experience it for themselves, po!

But once you see it,
you’ll never forget it.
It’s that kind of movie, po!

So please—if you haven’t seen it,
add it to your list, po!

💔 Amour (2012)

The second film is Amour, po—
a 2012 drama co-produced by Austria, France, and Germany.

This one is also about an elderly couple,
and the story revolves around caregiving and end-of-life love, po.

Caregiving is never easy, right, po?
This film makes you ask yourself:
“What would I do if I were in that situation?”
“What if someone I loved went through that?”

It really makes you think, po.

The pacing is slow and gentle—
it takes its time,
but not in a way that makes you bored or tired.

It’s more like a film you sit down to watch quietly,
with your heart calm and open, po.

After watching,
you’ll definitely feel the weight of it in your chest—
but also a deep, quiet appreciation for life and love.

Both movies are ones you’ll remember long after you’ve seen them, po.

So, Masters, Princesses,
please take your time and give them a watch, po!

But—one important thing, po!
When you watch these movies…

🧻 Prepare a full box of tissues! 🧻

Kobato is a total crybaby, po.
When she watches sad movies,
she ends up bawling her eyes out at home—like, Waaah! 😭

These two especially made Kobato cry nonstop, po!
So let’s all cry together—
Waaah, meow-meow, po! 🐈💦

If any of you Masters or Princesses have your own favorite or recommended movies,
please tell Kobato about them, po!
She’d love to know!

Alright, that’s all for today, po~!
This was Kobato and Torao, po!
See you next time! Bye-bye, po!

(“Ow, ow—Torao’s scratching, po!”)

Kuruppo~! 🕊️💞
