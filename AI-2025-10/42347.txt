Alright, everyone! Today we’re bringing you another remote recording from our homes, po!
This is already the second episode of our fan club radio series, po!

MISA:
Yay!

Because it’s remote, the sound might be a little rough here and there,
but please relax and enjoy, po!

So, how was the first episode, Masters and Princesses?
And what about you, members? How did you feel about it, po?

All:
It was fun!
So much fun!
I was drinking, po!

Kobato:
Wait, MISA-chan, are you drinking again today, po?

MISA:
I am!

Kobato:
I couldn’t see your glass, so I thought maybe not, po.
What are you drinking today, po?

MISA:
Highball!

Kobato:
Classic, po. You’re consistent, po.

So, we hope everyone enjoyed the first episode —
and now, welcome to our second, po!

Today’s theme is:
“What did you want to be when you were little?”

🍰 Kanami’s Dream – The Cake Shop Girl

Kobato:
Let’s start with Mincho, po!

Kanami:
People probably won’t believe me, but when I was little,
I wanted to be a cake shop owner.

Akane:
I knew it!

Kobato:
You totally called it, po!

Kanami:
Yep, I was obsessed with baking as a kid.
I really wanted to be a patissier,
so I used to bake a lot of cakes and sweets.
But once I started guitar, I completely stopped.
I’d rather spend my time practicing guitar than baking!

Kobato:
I remember seeing pictures, po! They looked delicious.

Kanami:
Yeah, during lockdown I started baking again,
kind of reminiscing about my childhood.

Kobato:
A nostalgic return to the sweet life, po!

👶 Akane’s Dream – The Kindergarten Teacher

Kobato:
Next, A-chan — what did you want to be, po?

Akane:
From kindergarten all the way to my last year of high school,
I always wanted to be a preschool teacher.

Kobato:
That’s so early, po!

Akane:
I just loved taking care of little kids.
I’m the youngest in my family, so I didn’t have younger siblings.
That’s why I enjoyed looking after the neighborhood kids —
it made me happy when they’d cling to me.
It was kind of like… early motherly instinct, I guess.

Kobato:
A born caretaker, po!

Akane:
Yeah, though for one mysterious year in high school
I suddenly wanted to be a hairdresser.
I even worked part-time at a salon!
But aside from that one year, it was always preschool teacher for me.

Kobato:
The “mystery hairdresser era,” po!

🕊️ Kobato’s Childhood – Great Escapes and Sailor Moon

Akane:
What about you, Kobato?

Kobato:
Well, little Kobato was a handful, po. (laughs)
When I was four, I used to sneak out while my mom was hanging laundry.
I’d play on the apartment stairs secretly—until one day, I slipped and fell headfirst onto the stone steps, po!
I made a huge bump above my eye, and my mom panicked and rushed me to the hospital, po!

Akane:
You haven’t changed. (laughs)

Kobato:
I know, po! I learned my lesson though—
no more escape missions, po!

As for what I wanted to be…
This might sound silly, but—
Sailor Moon, po!

Saiki:
(laughs) Of course!

Kobato:
I even think that’s why I ended up with twin tails, po!
And maybe that’s why I adopted a cat, too, po!

Saiki:
That makes perfect sense.

Kobato:
I also went through phases where I wanted to be a florist or a wagashi (Japanese sweets) shop owner, po.

MISA:
Wagashi? That’s so classic.

Kobato:
Right, po? I loved traditional sweets back in elementary school!

🐈 Saiki’s Childhood – “I Wanted to Be a Cat”

Kobato:
What about you, Sai-chan, po?

Saiki:
Hmm… I didn’t really have one.
If anything, I wanted to be a cat.

Kobato:
A cat, po!

Saiki:
Yeah, I never aimed for something big like “Sailor Moon.” That would’ve been presumptuous. (laughs)

All:
(laughs)

Saiki:
But kids really liked me, even when I was little.
Maybe that’s why my mom told me I should be a nursery teacher, too.

Kobato:
So even back then, Sai-chan was popular with kids, po!

Kanami:
Yeah, my nephew loves Saiki too! When I showed him a video, he was so happy.

Kobato:
That’s because he can sense your love aura, Kanami-chan, po!

Saiki:
Maybe! But yeah, I was always getting hugged by little kids.

Kobato:
And by boys, too, po?

Saiki:
(laughs) Yeah, I guess I was popular with boys too.

Kobato:
So nothing’s changed, po!

🍶 MISA’s Childhood – The Energetic Tomboy

Kobato:
Alright, MISA-chan, your turn, po!

MISA:
When I was in kindergarten, I was more energetic than all the boys.
Totally wild.
And—just like Kobato—I also wanted to be Sailor Moon!

All:
What?! (laughs)

MISA:
Yep. When I was three, my mom gave me a “Sailor Moon Ticket” for my birthday —
it said, “When you turn fourteen, you can become Sailor Moon.”
It was official stationery, with real art and everything.
I treasured it for years, keeping it in my desk drawer.

Kobato:
That’s adorable, po!

MISA:
Then when I turned fourteen, my mom said,

“So? You can become Sailor Moon now!”
And I said,
“There’s no way that’s real!”
She had waited eleven years for that joke!

All:
(laughs) That’s so cute!

Kobato:
Your mom’s sense of humor is incredible, po!

MISA:
Yeah. But honestly, I still kinda want to be Sailor Moon.

Saiki:
Same here.

Kobato:
We all do, po! The power of the moon never fades, po!

💫 Closing

Kobato:
So, turns out a lot of us had overlapping dreams, po!
Cake shops, teachers, Sailor Moon…
and one mysterious year as a hairdresser, po!

Akane:
(laughs) I still don’t know why that happened.

Kobato:
Now that we’ve reminisced about our childhoods,
let’s wrap up with our song of the day, chosen by MISA-chan, po!

MISA:
Okay! I want to make it a bit of a riddle, po!
It’s a song from an album starting with the letter “C,”
and the song title starts with “D.”

Kobato:
Hmm… Conqueror album… Dilemma, po?

MISA:
Correct! Please enjoy BAND-MAID’s Dilemma!

All:
Yay!

Kobato:
See you again, Masters and Princesses, po! Bye-bye! 🕊️
