🎥 Kobato & Akane

Kobato:
Kobato here!
And Akane here!
Today, we’re filming just the two of us.
Actually… this is already our third take, po!

We’ve been praying to the recording gods because we already talked for like twenty minutes twice,
and both times, somehow, the sound didn’t record.
So now we’re like, “This time for sure, please!” (laughs)

Okay, so our topic today is something we both share in common as musicians.
We’re both in rhythmic roles, so we thought we’d talk about our shared elements as performers.

So, A-chan — what do you think we have in common?

Akane:
Hmm… I think the biggest similarity is that we both do two different rhythms at once.

You know, for you as a guitar-vocalist, the vocal rhythm and the guitar rhythm are totally different —
you’re playing one rhythm while singing another.
And for me as a drummer, my hands and feet are all moving independently —
so it’s also about playing multiple rhythms at once.
That’s definitely something we have in common, I think.

Kobato:
That’s true, po! (laughs)
Even though we’ve talked about it twice already today, I keep forgetting what we said each time,
so it feels like a new conversation every take, po.

So when the rhythms between your hands and feet are totally different,
how do you practice that?
Like, how do you break it down, po?

Akane:
For me, I always start by understanding the hand rhythm first.
I don’t go through the whole song at once — I do it section by section: intro, verse, chorus.
Once I’ve grasped that, I add the footwork, and then I put it all together.

When we get a demo before recording, I write everything out into notation —
the full drum score.

Kobato:
All of it, po?!

Akane:
Yeah, every note.

Kobato:
That’s amazing! Most drummers don’t fully transcribe everything, right?
Usually they just jot down rough bars for the verses and choruses,
and maybe write out tricky fills or pauses.
But you — you write everything, down to every cymbal hit!

Akane:
Yeah, I do. I basically make my own full score.

Kobato:
It’s even more detailed than an official score, po! (laughs)
And she even writes notes like, “Focus on this here,” and “Be careful at this part.”
It’s like study notes for an exam, po!

Akane:
(laughs) Yeah, it really is.
I’m just so used to working from sheet music.
When I was a kid, I learned piano through sheet music,
and later, in middle and high school, I was in the brass band, playing trombone —
so reading notation was normal for me.
Then later, as a support musician at bars or sessions,
I’d be handed a chart on the spot and expected to play it immediately,
so I grew up in that “read and play instantly” environment.

Even though I transcribe everything by ear,
I always write it down before I play —
it makes my work so much faster.

Kobato:
That’s so cool. I’m the opposite, po.
For guitar, I do everything by ear, without writing it down.
I just keep playing and memorizing it until it’s in my body, po.

Akane:
By muscle memory, right?

Kobato:
Exactly.
And since BAND-MAID songs are so detailed and fast,
I can’t sing and play them right away, po.
Usually I memorize the guitar part first,
then add the vocals afterward.

There was a time I thought, “This is impossible!” (laughs)

Akane:
(laughs) I get that.

Kobato:
At first, I’d send my self-learned parts to Kanami-chan and ask,

“Am I doing this right, po?”
She’d check and say,
“This section’s off,”
and I’d fix just those bits.

But for acoustic guitar, it’s harder —
I forget the songs faster because I don’t play acoustic often, po.

Akane:
Ah, yeah, that makes sense.

Kobato:
And since acoustic songs have fewer notes,
I actually write some light notation or chord memos for those,
just so I don’t forget.

Akane:
So even for vocals, you sometimes write little notes, right?

Kobato:
Yeah, when I’m writing lyrics, I kind of memorize the song naturally.
If I need to remind myself of melody placement,
I’ll sometimes scribble a little rhythmic note above the lyrics, po.
But by the time recording starts, it’s all in my head.

Akane:
That’s amazing.

Kobato:
Still, BAND-MAID songs are so tricky, po.
The guitar rhythm and the vocal rhythm don’t usually match at all!
And the lyrics Kanami writes are packed with words,
so just fitting everything rhythmically is hard, po.

Akane:
Yeah, I think that’s one of the hardest things about our songs.

Kobato:
Exactly.
Even when we all tried playing each other’s parts once,
we all went, “Nope. Impossible.” (laughs)

Akane:
(laughs) Yeah, every song has at least one spot that’s totally insane.

Kobato:
It’s crazy. And when we do it live,
sometimes we simplify it just a little, po —
because otherwise it’d be chaos.

Akane:
Yeah, but that’s the charm of having two vocalists —
those overlapping, impossible rhythms.

Kobato:
Still, I really admire people who can do solo instruments and vocals at once —
like bass-vocalists, or even drum-vocalists.
They’re amazing, po.

Akane:
Yeah, seriously.

Kobato:
Even doing simple “whoa-whoa” or “no mercy” shouts is hard enough for me.
If the rhythm’s not exactly on the beat, I completely lose track, po.

Akane:
Yeah, it’s the same for me.
If I don’t have the vocals playing while practicing,
I’ll get lost mid-song.
I rely on the vocals to know where we are —
verse, chorus, bridge… without them, I get confused.

Kobato:
Right? I totally get that.
Especially when rehearsing new songs —
if you miss one repeat, you’re gone, po.

Akane:
(laughs) Yeah. For us, since drums don’t have chords,
it’s easy to lose the sense of structure.
That’s why I depend on the vocals as my guide.

Kobato:
Makes sense, po.
And MISA’s bass lines are often very melodic,
so you two are constantly coordinating the rhythm foundation.

Akane:
Exactly. The drum kick and MISA’s low-end groove
have to lock perfectly — otherwise everything collapses.

Kobato:
So in a way, you and MISA are like the foundation,
and my guitar rhythms connect to that same base layer.
That’s our shared rhythm bond, po!

Akane:
Totally. Especially in songs like Black Hole,
where everything’s fast and intricate —
that one was brutal.

Kobato:
So fast, po! I thought your hands were going to fly off!

Akane:
(laughs) Yeah, that one’s chaos.

Kobato:
I fell asleep just listening to it, po!

Akane:
(laughs) I bet.

Kobato:
Anyway, let’s pray Kanami doesn’t bring us an even faster one next time, po.

Akane:
Amen to that!

Kobato:
But yeah, to all our Masters and Princesses —
when you listen to BAND-MAID songs next time,
try focusing on the connection between the drums and guitar rhythm, po.
It might change how you hear the songs!

That’s it for today! Bye-bye, po! 🕊️
