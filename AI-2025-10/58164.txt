🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (June)

MISA:
Hey, it’s MISA.

My “Song of the Month” is “Anemone.”

Lately, it’s been raining a lot,
but one day, after the rain, the evening sky was glowing beautifully—
it was such a soothing, healing sight.

That’s when this song came to mind.
It just started flowing through me naturally—“Anemone.”

Alright then… time for a drink.

Bye-bye.
