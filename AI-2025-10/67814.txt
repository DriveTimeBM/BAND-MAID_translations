🎵 Song of the Month – MISA (January 2022)

Hey, it’s MISA.

For this month’s song, I’ll go with “Play.”

Lately, I’ve been watching a lot of our live videos on YouTube,
and it made me really want to perform “Play” in front of everyone again soon.

We made several different arrangements for the intro section of that song, right?
How many versions were there in the end?
Honestly, I don’t remember.
If anyone knows, please tell me.

The photo is of the ozōni (New Year’s soup) I had during the New Year.

See you!
