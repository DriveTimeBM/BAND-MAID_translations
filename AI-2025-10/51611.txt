**Kanami:**
Hello, itâ€™s Kanamincho! Howâ€™s everyone doing?

For my at-home time, what I enjoy most is **grinding coffee beans myself**  
and then brewing a **drip coffee**.  

To avoid taking in too much caffeine, I switch to **decaf coffee** after the second cup.  

If youâ€™ve never tried grinding and dripping your own coffee before,  
I really recommend giving it a try!  
There are lots of tutorials on YouTube showing how to do it,  
so please, please check them out and try it for yourself.  

Thatâ€™s all from Kanamincho!
