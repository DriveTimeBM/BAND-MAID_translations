🎬 BAND-MAID – “Different” MV: Behind the Scenes

Kobato (Speaker 1):
It’s the first time doing this kind of shoot—it looks like it’s going to be fun, po!
Right, right… “Mi-chu, Mi-chu, Mi-chu,” po! (nonsense humming, laughing)
Ah, perfect! That’s wonderful, po!
Maybe we should make this into a recital, po? Yeah—a recital, not a live show!

[Unknown speaker]:
A recital? Which one of us sings?

Kobato:
We’ll sing like this, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
That mic’s so close—it’s practically touching your face!

Kobato:
One mic is enough, po!

[Unknown speaker]:
How are you feeling about today’s shoot?

Kobato:
Full of energy and brightness, po!
Energetic, cheerful, and bright!
And also: energetic, proper, and beautiful, po!
Diligence, cleanliness, and spirit—energetic, proper, and beautiful!

I’ll do my best, po!

I’ll move my hands super fast today—
Which movement do you think MISA can do the fastest, po?

[Unknown speaker]:
She’s like a bug—it’s scary how fast she moves!

Kobato:
So fast, po! Ow!

[Unknown speaker]:
We’ll open again soon, please wait a moment—sorry for the confusion.

Kobato:
Yes, ready to go, po!

Kobato (closing comment):
It’s been a long time since we’ve had a music video shoot this exhausting, po!
But it’s full of powerful performance scenes, so it’s definitely worth watching.

Please watch it lots and lots, po!
Goodbye, po! 👋
