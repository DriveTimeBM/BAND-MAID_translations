🎵 Song of the Month – Akane (January 2022)

Akane:
Hi, it’s Akane.

The song I chose for this month is “Dilemma.”

There have been times when I wanted to do Okyuji with all our Masters and Princesses
but couldn’t, or when I wanted all five of us to hang out outside of work
but we weren’t able to meet.

So many situations like that—
but this year, I’m wishing for it to be one where we can blow away all those dilemmas!

That’s why I chose this song.

Please continue supporting BAND-MAID in 2022!
Let’s make it another fun year.

This was Akane. Bye-bye!
