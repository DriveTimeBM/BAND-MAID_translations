🎥 Kanami’s Room – Looking Back on Precious Memories

Kanami:
How are you doing, Masters and Princesses?
This is Kanami, the guitarist. 🎸

Today, I was thinking about what to do for this video,
and while scrolling through my phone,
I found a lot of nostalgic photos.

So for this episode, I thought I’d pick a few of them
and look back together with you,
reminiscing about those sweet memories.

Let’s start with this one—
a photo from June 28, 2018 (Heisei 30).

It’s June 25th today,
which means that two years ago around this time…
we were in Mexico! 🇲🇽

We went there for an Okyuji (concert).

At first, when we used to go to Mexico,
there weren’t any direct flights,
so we had to transit through another country first.
It was such a long journey—I still remember how tough it was.

But around that time,
they started offering direct flights from Japan to Mexico!
It was amazing—about 14 or 15 hours straight,
and we could get there without changing planes.
I remember being so moved by that!

That said,
a 14–15 hour flight is still hard on the body. (laughs)
So we always make sure to stretch,
adjust our sleep schedules,
and plan our rest carefully before flying overseas.

Anyway, back to the photo—
this one was taken during a Mexican TV program shoot.
We were so surprised and excited to be invited!
It was such a rare and valuable experience—
one we’ll never forget.

Also, that hotel in Mexico had a pool,
so I remember going swimming there with A-chan (Akane) and Sai-chan (Saiki).
We brought swimsuits and had such a fun time together! 🏊‍♀️

Such wonderful memories.

🇲🇾 Malaysia – July 7, 2018

Next photo!
This one’s from July 7, 2018,
when we went to Malaysia.

We were invited to perform at a J-pop culture event.
It was our first time in Malaysia!

I still remember stepping outside the airport and being shocked—
the moment we went outdoors, it was so hot! ☀️
Everyone was drenched in sweat!

But it wasn’t an unpleasant kind of sweat—
more like the sweat you get from exercising.
So even though it was hot, it didn’t feel too bad.

Anyway, the food was amazing.

The photo you’re seeing now—
that’s lobster! 🦞

It was so juicy and delicious.
We ordered so many dishes together—
there was coconut-flavored rice,
spicy curry that paired perfectly with it…
Every single thing we ate was delicious!

That’s when I realized how good Malaysian food is.

In that photo, you can see Kobato-san and Sai-chan sitting with me,
but next to us were MISA and A-chan.
We all ate together.

We often eat together like that,
not only overseas but in Japan too.
I always think to myself how lucky I am
to have such wonderful members.

They’re like both friends and family to me.
We don’t have to worry about formalities,
we can just relax and enjoy being together.

Really, I’m so grateful to have them.
Members—thank you, always. 💖

🍑 “Momotarō Play” in Okayama

Alright, next photo.

Some of you might recognize it!
I actually posted a similar one on Twitter or Instagram before.

It’s a picture of A-chan and Sai-chan making something together late at night.

They were working so hard,
and I was lying on the bed like this,
watching them while taking photos with my phone. (laughs)

Do you know what this photo was from?

Here’s the answer!
It was from our Okayama Okyuji on September 24th.

As you know, Okayama is MISA’s hometown,
and it’s also famous for Momotarō (Peach Boy). 🍑

So we all decided to do a little “Momotarō play” together!

I know some of you might be thinking,
“What on earth is a Momotarō play?” (laughs)

Well, during that tour,
we had a plan to do a local surprise in every city.
Something fun during the MC segment—
a little regional-themed performance or gag.

And since A-chan loves local gags and surprises,
she came up with ideas for each place
and prepared everything for us.

That Okayama show was so much fun—
we had such a good time with that silly little skit! (laughs)

We probably won’t do things like that anymore,
so if you were one of the Masters or Princesses
who attended that Okyuji…
you witnessed something rare! 💎

BAND-MAID loves doing goofy things like that—
funny, silly moments.
But we’re also very serious about music.

Every member is hardworking,
dedicated, and kind—
a wonderful balance of funny and sincere.

I feel truly blessed
to be surrounded by such amazing members—
fun, kind, caring, and always giving their best.

Really, members—thank you, always. 💐

If you didn’t enjoy it—

If it wasn’t interesting,
I’ll come up with something else next time!
But if you liked it,
maybe I’ll do another one like this again.

Alright then—
that’s all for today.
Thank you very much! 🌸
