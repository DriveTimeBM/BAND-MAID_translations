🎥 Maid’s Room – Summer Movie Recommendations (Episode 5)

Welcome home, Masters and Princesses—kuruppo! 🕊️✨
This is Kobato Miku, po!
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap! 👏👏👏👏👏

Alright—
it’s time for the fifth episode of Kobato’s Room, po!

This time, Kobato will be introducing three movies, po!
Three movies perfect for summer, po! ☀️

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap! 👏👏👏👏👏

🦈 1. MEG: The Monster (2018)

First up!
MEG: The Monster!

This film is a 2018 American–Chinese co-production,
and it’s a science fiction action film, po!

This movie features something Kobato absolutely loves…
sharks!, po! 🦈

The story goes like this:
a prehistoric shark—the Megalodon,
which was thought to have gone extinct over 2 million years ago—
somehow returns to life!

So everyone bands together
to try to hunt it down…
or rather, to defeat it, po!

Now, shark movies are often seen as “B-movies,” right, po?
But MEG actually has a solid story and production—
it’s a well-made, proper shark movie, po!

Kobato actually first saw it on an airplane, po!
She’s watched a lot of shark movies—
you know, ones with flying sharks,
or sharks that fuse with giant squids—
Kobato loves that kind of thing, po! (laughs)

But MEG felt a bit different—
it was more like a genuine movie, po!
A real, cinematic shark film!

So, since it’s summer—
and summer means sharks—
Kobato highly recommends that Masters and Princesses watch this one, po!

🌻 2. Summer Wars (2009)

Next up—
Summer Wars!

I’m sure many of you already know this one, po!
It’s a 2009 Japanese animated film,
directed by the brilliant Mamoru Hosoda, po!

Did you know—
this was actually Hosoda’s first full-length original film, po?
Kobato only learned that recently while researching, po!
Amazing, right, po?

The story is about an ordinary high school boy
who gets caught up in a huge incident
inside the virtual world “OZ.”

Within that chaos,
you see the warmth of family bonds,
and the importance of human connection,
portrayed so beautifully, po.

It’s such a heartfelt, moving story
that makes you think,
“Japan’s countryside and families are such wonderful things,” po.

It really gives you that warm, nostalgic,
‘This is what Japan feels like’ kind of emotion, po.

And yes… Kobato always cries a lot watching Summer Wars, po. 😭
Even though I’ve seen it so many times—
I still end up crying, po!
Every single time!

It’s that good, po!
So for any Masters and Princesses who haven’t seen it yet—
please, go watch it right now, po!

🕹️ 3. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)

And finally!
The third movie is…
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle! 🎮

Oh—Tora-chan is rolling around! (laughs) 🐈

This is a 2017 American 3D action-adventure film, po!

You might know the Jumanji series—
the original movie came out in 1995,
and this one is its continuation, po!

The main star is none other than The Rock—
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson! 💪

The story goes like this:
a group of high school students gets pulled into a video game world!

The main character in the real world
is a bit of a weak, timid boy—
but once he enters the game,
he becomes The Rock—
a huge, super-muscular, macho hero! (laughs)

Inside the game,
he embarks on an adventure,
and soon, his friends follow him into the game too!

It’s a story about friendship,
but also packed with comedy and action, po!
You’ll laugh a lot watching this one, po!

Kobato doesn’t even want to explain it too much—
because it’s just so funny and entertaining, po!
You simply have to watch it, po!

For those who haven’t seen it yet,
please do!
And for those who already have—
let’s rewatch it together this summer, po!

Ah—Tora-chan!
Tora-chan’s getting mischievous again, po!
Come here, po!

Anyway—
these are all movies Kobato really wants you to enjoy, po!

If there are any movies you love to watch during summer,
please tell Kobato about them, po!

She’d love to know your favorites, po!

Alright then—
that was Torao and Kobato’s Room, episode 5, po!

Kobato’s looking forward to chatting with all of you
about movies again soon, po!

Right, Tora-chan?
Bye-bye, po! Kuruppo~! 🕊️💞
